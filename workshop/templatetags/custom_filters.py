# This is a LIST in Python, not a chain of `{% if p|slice:… == '/x/' %}` clauses
# in base.html, because that chain is what the highlight used to be — and it had
# silently fallen two sections behind. Both **Salary & Advance** and
# **Estimates** were in the drawer but missing from it, so opening either left
# Manage looking inactive on a page that is only reachable through it. A missing
# entry in a ten-clause boolean is invisible; a missing entry in a list is one
# line to add, and `NavHighlightTests` checks every drawer link is covered.

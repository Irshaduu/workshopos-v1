# STEERING AN ENTRY TO THE SECTION THAT OWNS IT
# =============================================================================
# Three kinds of money have a dedicated section AND land wrong if they are
# typed here instead, so the Cashbook asks before taking one:
#
#   * WAGES are counted from Salary & Advance. A "Staff salary 40,000" row here
#     is counted TWICE — the Profit page already warns about it after the fact
#     ("wages may be counted twice"), and this is the same fact said before it
#     happens rather than a month later.
#   * AN OWNER DRAW is not an expense at all. `cashbook_expense()` feeds the
#     profit equation, so "Sahad 5,000" here quietly cuts reported profit by
#     5,000 — and the next distribution is decided from the smaller figure.
#     That is the exact defect `OwnerWithdrawal` was built to remove, and in a
#     rush an owner's own NAME is what gets typed.
#   * RENT belongs in Deposit & Rent — all of it. The monthly charge is read
#     from the rate there and the daily handovers are recorded there, so
#     either one typed here is counted twice.
#
# ⚠ THE COMMENT HERE USED TO SAY THE OPPOSITE OF THE CODE BELOW IT, and both
# were written in the same commit (`c594ee8`). It read: '"RENT" IS DELIBERATELY
# NOT IN THIS LIST, and adding it would cost the workshop ₹35,000 a month of
# expense … The word joins this list on the day that line lands, and not
# before' — while the very next declaration was `(['rent', 'deposit'], …)`.
#
# The reasoning was sound and the code never matched it. It also stopped being
# the right reasoning on 2026-09-04: rent now HAS an expense line of its own,
# read from `RentRate`, so the word belongs here and the wording gets SIMPLER
# rather than more careful — exactly as that comment predicted it would.
#
# ⚠ THE WORDS COME FROM `analysis_engine.RENT_WORDS`, imported rather than
# restated, for the reason the shop words are: the entry-time steer and the
# Profit page's own "rent may be counted twice" warning must never come to
# mean different things. `_steers()` adds ONE pair of words the flag does not
# carry — see the note there.
#
# ⚠ IT ASKS, IT NEVER BLOCKS. "Rent agreement stamp paper", "Advance to a
# supplier" and a staff member who shares an owner's first name are all real,
# so a refusal would be wrong and a person who cannot get their work done
# routes around the tool. The app's own rule, from the settle dialog.
#
# ⚠ IT IS A BROWSER PROMPT AND NOTHING ELSE, on purpose. This catches a
# TYPO MADE IN A RUSH; a crafted POST is not that, so there is no server guard
# to write and none to keep in step. What the server does own is the money
# rules themselves, which are unchanged.
# ⚠ EACH ONE IS A QUESTION, THEN THE CONSEQUENCE. That shape is the owner's
# own, after the first attempt shipped as flat statements and they said it did
# not read as stopping them: "Sahad is an owner — money they took belongs in
# Owner Withdrawals" is a FACT, and a fact slides past somebody in a hurry.
# A question ("Is this money an owner took?") makes the reader answer it, and
# naming what goes wrong ("it makes the profit look smaller") is what makes
# answering worth the second it costs. Read in one eye scan, in this order:
#
#     ASK  -> what would go wrong -> where it belongs
#
# `ask` is the heading, `why` the line under it. Both are short on purpose;
# anything longer is read as prose and skipped.

#: A row whose words are resolved at CALL time from `analysis_engine`, so the
#: steer and that page's own warning read one list. `_steers()` fills them in.
#: Sentinel objects rather than `None`, which said "shops" by convention and
#: could not name a second such row.

# =============================================================================
# VIEWS PACKAGE — Backward-Compatible Re-Export Layer
# =============================================================================
# This package splits the original monolithic views.py into logical modules.
# All view functions are re-exported here so that `from . import views`
# and `views.some_function` continue to work without any URL changes.

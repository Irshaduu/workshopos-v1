"""
The job card, READ ONLY — laid out to the owner's own sketch (2026-08-18).

Two rebuilds in two days, and the second is the one that matters. The first kept
the edit form's shape: a section per fact, a label over every value. The owner
read it back as "still useless because it's confusing" and drew what they wanted
instead — three unlabelled lines of identity, then the four lists as a 2×2 grid,
with nothing under a part but its dates and its figures.

So the rule this file exists to protect is: THERE ARE NO LABELS. Every caption
removed is one fewer thing to read on a page four people open twenty times a
day, and the owner's own reasoning is why that is safe — "few times repeatedly
see, humans will understand and adapt easily." A test that lets a "Qty:" or a
"Customer:" creep back is letting the page slide back to the version that was
rejected.

What else is pinned:
  · nothing on it posts — that is the whole argument for it existing at all;
  · Office and Owner only, which is what lets the layout be this dense;
  · the four sections are the dashboard drawer's, not an approximation of it;
  · and no figure is ever printed twice on the money line.

        THE WRAPPER, NOT THE BUTTON, PUT THE KEBAB IN THE WRONG PLACE.

        Bootstrap's `.dropdown` is a plain inline box, so inside the <h1> it
        inherited the heading's 36.8px line-height and the inline-block button
        sat on THAT line box's baseline. Measured: a 40px wrapper around a 32px
        button, with the button 8px below the top of its row — and since the
        strut then set the row's height, the corner the button was meant to sit

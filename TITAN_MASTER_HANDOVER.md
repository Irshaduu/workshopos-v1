## I. The mission

**WorkshopOS** is built for **one** premium automotive workshop — appointment-driven,
high-value vehicles, about 30 cars a month, six or seven staff, two owners. Not a
high-volume chain garage.

That distinction is load-bearing throughout. It is why RBAC needs three tiers and not
a permission matrix, why labour is quoted whole instead of costed by the hour, why
leave days are typed once a month instead of tracked daily, and why performance is
judged against real volume rather than generic "web scale".

**The standard:** functional integrity across every operation that touches money or
access. Backed by **91 test files / 3,157 tests** (re-counted 2026-10-09) covering security, views, signals,
financial logic, cashbook, spare shops, salary settlement, the profit engine, the
printed documents, photos and the email transport behind password reset.

⚠ Re-count rather than trusting that figure — it has gone stale repeatedly. The
counter is in `CLAUDE.md` § Testing conventions.

---

## II. Core architecture — the "Steel Gate"

> This section is the mission-critical security and data-integrity logic. These
> systems are foundational and must not be broken or bypassed. Full reasoning for
> each rule is in `CLAUDE.md`; this is the map.

### 1. Sign-in lockouts — two units

- **Primary, per account (`AccountLockout`)** — 5 consecutive failures lock **that
  one account** for 15 minutes.
- **Backstop, per IP (`FailedAttempt`)** — 20 failures lock the network. Counted
  by the visitor's IP from `workshop/client_ip.py`: behind Railway's proxy that
  is the first `X-Forwarded-For` value, which Railway sets (measured
  2026-09-21 — `REMOTE_ADDR` there is the proxy itself, AUD-0107); a direct
  connection's header is still ignored, to prevent spoofed-IP bypass.

**Why the split:** the IP threshold used to be 5, and that was the wrong unit for
this business. The laptop, the tablet and both owners' phones leave through one
connection, so five fumbled attempts on the Floor tablet locked the owners out of
their own devices — the attack and the collateral damage were indistinguishable. The
account gate is the precise instrument now; the IP gate only catches a spray across
many accounts. **Don't lower it back.**

→ `workshop/tests/test_login.py`, `workshop/tests/tests.py`. Tests touching either
must clear `FailedAttempt.objects.all()` in `setUp`.

### 2. Login — one door

**`/login/` is the only sign-in page and any role uses it.** It reads `Sign In` /
`Identifier` and names no roles. `/admin-login/` redirects to it, kept alive for the
owners' bookmarks.

There were two faces — a blue "Staff Sign In" and a red "Admin Sign In" on one view.
They **gated nothing**, since either accepted any role; they only announced to anyone
who typed the address that privileged accounts exist and where their door is.

- **Sign in with username, email, or mobile.** `resolve_user_by_identifier` tries each
  in order and **fails closed** if more than one account matches.
- **Owners sign in by email address only.** A mobile resolves by its last ten digits,
  so the workshop's *published* phone was a valid owner identifier — and being
  nameable at this form is what lets someone lock an owner out five tries at a time.
  Office and Floor still use usernames; the reset flow still accepts any identifier,
  on purpose.
  ⚠ **Tell the owners:** typing a username gets "Invalid credentials", which cannot
  be worded more helpfully without confirming the account exists.
- **RBAC returns 403, not a login redirect, for signed-in users.** Anonymous visitors
  still get the sign-in page with `?next=`, validated against open redirects by
  `_safe_next`.

### 3. Password recovery

- **Change Password** (`/change-password/`, Owner-only) — a signed-in owner sets a new
  password with no email involved. This is the **handover path**: an owner gets a temp
  password verbally, signs in, replaces it. **Go-live therefore does not depend on
  email working on the day.** There is deliberately **no link to it in the UI**;
  don't delete it as dead code.
- **Forgot Password** — a **6-digit code emailed** to the owner's registered address.
  Chosen over Django's built-in reset *link* because on iOS an installed PWA has its
  own cookie jar, so a link tapped in the mail app completes the reset in a
  *different* session and leaves the app signed out. **The owners read this on
  iPhones.** Do not "simplify" it back.
- Every limit (10-min expiry, single use, 5 attempts, 60s resend, 3/hour) is counted
  **per account in the database**, not in the session — a session counter is defeated
  by clearing cookies. Responses are identical whether or not the account exists.
- **A reset clears `AccountLockout`.** Owners cannot be unlocked from Control Hub, so
  the emailed code is a locked-out owner's only self-service route back.
- **Owner identity lives in the database, not `.env`** — adding an owner or changing
  an address needs no deploy (`sync_owner_identity`, `set_owner_email`).

### 4. Notifications — one catalogue

The nav bell is an owner-only feed at `/notifications/` with an unread badge,
mark-one-on-open, mark-all-read, and a 14-day sweep of *read* rows.

**20 events, all Owner-audience, all declared in `workshop/notifications.py`**
(re-counted 2026-09-22).

| Severity | Behaviour | Events |
|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** (15) | push to a phone + feed | `LOGIN`, `STAFF_LOGIN`, `ACCOUNT_LOCKED`, `PASSWORD_RESET`, `RESET_CODE_LIMIT`, `RESET_CODE_ATTEMPTS_SPENT`, `USER_CREATED`, `USER_DELETED`, `STAFF_PASSWORD_SET`, `HIGH_DISCOUNT`, `RECORD_DELETED`, `RENT_RATE_SET`, `DATED_BACK_PAST_LIMIT`, `OLD_RECORD_CHANGED`, `WITHDRAWAL_ADDED` |
| **INFO** (5) | feed only | `ACCOUNT_ARCHIVED`, `SALARY_ADVANCE`, `SALARY_SETTLED`, `DATED_BACK`, `RECORD_CHANGED` |

- **Money moved in time or retyped is two pairs, and the tier is the record's**
  (2026-09-22): anything Office is allowed to do (date back up to 3 days; edit
  or delete within 24 hours of keying) goes to the bell; anything only an owner
  can do goes to the other owner's phone. They replaced `RENT_BACKDATED` and
  `CASHBOOK_EDITED`, which each covered one section.

- **`RECORD_DELETED` hooks `DeletionLog.record()`** — the single choke point every
  permanent delete already passes through, so one call covers all **fourteen** entity
  types and anything added later.
- **`RECORD_CHANGED` / `OLD_RECORD_CHANGED` hook `EditLog.record()`** the same way
  (2026-09-23): it keeps the Edit History row and then calls `notify_changed()`,
  its only caller, so an edit is announced if and only if it is kept. A test scans
  the source for a door that goes round it.
- **The actor is excluded from their own events**, which roughly halves volume with
  two owners; **Floor receives nothing at all**. Notification fatigue is the failure
  mode here: a bell that cries wolf stops being read, and the events that matter
  (large discount, permanent delete) are exactly the ones that would be missed.
- ⚠ **GETTING IN ALWAYS PUSHES — all three, and this reverses what this doc said
  until 2026-08-29.** It read *"an Office or Floor sign-in pushes; an owner sign-in
  does not"*, with `LOGIN` at INFO because an owner signing in is routine. What
  overruled it: an owner account is the highest-privilege thing in this system, and a
  sign-in on one with a **stolen password reached no phone at all** — `PASSWORD_RESET`
  pushes, but only if the intruder went through the reset flow. Volume is what keeps
  it safe, the same argument `STAFF_LOGIN` already rested on: the session cookie lasts
  40 days, so this fires on a genuinely new session, roughly one or two a month across
  two owners. The two events stay split because the tier was never all the split
  carried — the titles differ, and a staff alert leads its `detail` with the ROLE.
- **The two reset-abuse events are the only ones raised with no actor**, so they reach
  both owners including the one targeted, de-duped to one per account per hour.
- **A row is three strings** (`0074` added the third): `body` is the loud line and a
  complete statement ending in what happened; `title` is the category; `detail` is the
  context read second. Nothing that decides what a row MEANS may live in `detail`.
  Both the feed and the push lead with `body` — the push used to send the CATEGORY as
  its bold line, so nine alerts in a row opened with "Record deleted" and the
  ₹1,00,000 sat in the small type below.
- ⚠ **A push carries no `tag`.** It used to carry a constant one, which is a *replace*
  key, so every push replaced the one before it: two deletions a minute apart showed
  as one, and a staff sign-in wiped a ₹1,00,000 record deletion off the lock screen
  before anybody read it. Only CRITICAL events reach the push path and none of them
  supersedes any other, so there is nothing here a later alert is entitled to replace.
- `HIGH_DISCOUNT` uses `JobCard.HIGH_DISCOUNT_AMOUNT` — **a flat ₹3,500** — the same
  constant as `audit_high_discounts` and the settle dialog, so none can disagree about
  what "large" means.

### 5. Web Push — a delivery layer, never a source of truth

- **CRITICAL events push to subscribed devices; INFO events wait in the bell.** Push
  sits over `Notification` rows that are already written — missing keys, a dead
  service, or nobody subscribed leaves the feed completely unaffected. That is why it
  was built last.
- **One subscription per device**, toggled by the small bell in the panel header.
- **`sw.js` is served from the origin root** by a Django view, never `/static/` — a
  service worker's scope is its own directory.
- **Nothing in the request path waits on the network**: `transaction.on_commit` → a
  background thread.
- **iOS caveat, unavoidable:** Web Push works only once the app is added to the Home
  Screen. In a normal Safari tab the API is absent, and the UI says so.
- ⚠ **Registration, install state and subscriptions are all per-origin** — every
  device must re-enable push after a change of host or domain.
- **Optional everywhere.** A deploy without `VAPID_*` keys is valid.

### 6. Outbound network calls

**The app makes exactly two kinds, both optional and neither on the request path:**
the password-reset email, and Web Push. There is no SMS or chat integration, and none
is to be added.

Mail leaves over **Resend's HTTPS API in production** (Railway blocks outbound SMTP
below its Pro plan) and SMTP in development. There is exactly one `send_mail()` call
site, so the flow, the throttles and the tests are identical on both.

### 7. Session command (`UserSession`)

Device parsing turns raw User-Agent strings into human-readable names (*Apple Safari
on iPhone*). Owners get full visibility over active staff sessions (40-day window) and
can remotely terminate any of them from the management dashboard.

### 8. The warehouse pulse — stock delta engine

Django signals in `inventory/signals.py` orchestrate stock across **four independent
groups (13 handlers)**, all using the same pre_save-snapshot + post_save-delta pattern:

1. **Workshop consumption** (3) — replacement, quantity adjustment, deletion. Deducts
   for `source='INVENTORY'` rows only, resolved through the `item` FK.
2. **JobCard soft-delete reversal** (2) — **dormant.** Job cards are hard-deleted and
   the delete guard forbids deleting a card that still holds spares.
3. **Supplier restocking** (5) — three on `SupplierRestockItem` (creation, edit,
   deletion), which with group 4 are the **only** things that move `Item.avg_cost`;
   plus a `SupplierRestockBill` pre/post_save pair that re-costs the bill's lines when
   its **date** changes, since the date does not live on a line. (A bill carries no
   discount of its own since 2026-09-29.)
4. **Opening stock** (3) — the go-live shelf count, added 2026-09-19. It belongs to no
   shop, so it moves the shelf without touching any balance, and it is why the count
   is a signal rather than a view writing `current_stock`: that would have been the
   system's first exception to its own rule.

**Warehouse stock is allowed to go negative**, deliberately — a negative balance is
self-healing and is the signal that a Supplies Shop bill is missing. See `CLAUDE.md`.

### 9. Owner Analysis & Reports

Two pages: **`/analysis/`** (Profit — `Turnover − Expenses = Profit` for one date
window, used for profit distribution, deliberately plain) and **`/analysis/insights/`**
(Deep Analysis — mechanics, spare parts, inventory, vehicles, fleet, shops,
cashbook, operations, one AJAX-loaded section at a time).

- **Turnover** = car bills (`total_bill_amount − discount_amount`) + cashbook income.
  A discount is money never earned, so it reduces turnover rather than appearing as an
  expense; for a settled card the result equals `received_amount` to the rupee.
- **Expenses** are five non-overlapping streams, all on ONE basis — what the work done
  in this period cost: Spare Shops, Inventory Used, Salary & Advance, Cashbook Expense
  and Rent (read from the rate and charged in whole months — never the daily deposits,
  which are cash). A part is charged when it is **fitted to a car**, whichever shelf it
  came off.
- **A Supplies Shop bill is NOT an expense.** Buying stock turns cash into goods on a
  shelf; it raises the payable and the shelf and nothing else. A supplier *payment*
  moves the payable again. Neither touches profit.
- **The same profit is then stated a second way**, in the owner's own terms: Labour +
  Spare Parts margin + Inventory margin + Cashbook Income = Gross Earnings, less salary,
  rent and cashbook expense. It closes with **no reconciling line** — which is only true
  because both halves charge stock at the same moment. A bridging row reappearing there
  means the two bases have drifted apart. → `TheProfitIsAlsoSaidTheOwnersWayTests`
- **Changed 2026-08-25, on the owner's decision.** The bill used to be the expense and
  the draw excluded — which put the two parts routes on two different bases (the spare
  route has always charged on fitting) and made monthly profit lumpy. The trade: profit
  now leans on `avg_cost`, so the uncosted-draw warning is load-bearing.
- **The double-count rule** — a part is charged exactly once, when it is fitted. For a
  warehouse part that is the draw, at the shelf's average cost, so the Supplies Shop
  bill that filled the shelf must never be added alongside it: that charges one
  delivery twice (~₹6.9L against the seeded data). *Until 2026-09-15 this bullet still
  described the rule from before 2026-08-25 — bill charged, draw excluded — directly
  under the bullet saying that rule had changed.*
  → `DoubleCountRuleTests`
- **All money math lives in `analysis_engine.py`** as pure functions; views only
  resolve the window and render, so a charting bug can never become a profit bug.
  `monthly_series()` is asserted to total exactly to `build_profit_report()`.
- **XSS:** no `{{ variable|safe }}`. All JS data injection uses `json_script`.

### 10. Billing & the Fleet Account cascade

- **Locking**: `select_for_update()` inside `transaction.atomic()`, oldest-first, when
  a payment cascades across multiple unpaid job cards.
- **Advance credit**: `BulkPayer.advance_balance` banks any surplus and is pooled into
  the next payment, so `total_balance` can legitimately show negative (in credit).
- **Financial precision**: every monetary column is
  `DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)`. `FloatField` is prohibited.
- **Deletion model**: accounts that other records reference (Spare Shops, Fleet
  Accounts, Supplier Shops, Mechanics) are **archived, never hard-deleted**;
  transactions and job cards are **permanently deleted but snapshotted first** to the
  Owner-only `DeletionLog`. A guard blocks deleting a job card that still holds
  spares, labour or a received payment. `on_delete=PROTECT` appears exactly three
  times: inventory `Category → Item`, a warehouse draw's `JobCardSpareItem.item`, and
  `OwnerWithdrawal.owner`.
- **Dedicated ledgers**: split Pending / Paid Bills with time-range filters and
  enforced RBAC.
- **A warranty card is never a bill**: `JobCard.save()` holds it at ₹0 and
  unsettled on every save, the settle and fleet doors refuse it, and `bill_cards()`
  — `live_cards()` without warranty cards — is what every bill list and average reads.

---

## III. Performance engineering

Deliberate, standard patterns — appropriate headroom for a workshop's real volume, not
a claim of internet-scale throughput.

- **Server-side pagination** on all major list views (45 items; 10 for category grids).
- **Query hardening** — `select_related`/`prefetch_related` throughout.
- **Zero-query properties** — methods like `get_completion_percentage` check for
  pre-annotated fields before hitting the database.
- **Denormalized financials** — `JobCard.total_bill_amount` is a physical column
  updated via `update_totals()`, not computed at read time.
- **Indexing** — `db_index=True` on high-traffic lookups (`is_deleted`, `completed`,
  `registration_number`, `admitted_date`, `paid_date`, `brand_name`, `model_name`),
  plus a composite `[is_deleted, completed, -updated_at]` for the dashboard query
  pattern, and per-model composites on notifications, photos, cashbook and the
  deletion log.

> **No load testing at extreme scale has been performed.** If that claim is ever
> needed for a deployment, back it with an actual benchmark rather than asserting it
> here.

**The job-card form's hot spot is closed (2026-09-21).** It cost extra queries
for every part on the card — role lookups (`AUD-0008`) and a parts query asked
afresh several times per row (`AUD-0096`). The edit page now costs **16 queries
whatever the card carries**, measured at 1, 8 and 15 parts of each kind in the test
database, and `test_jobcard_form_queries.py` holds it there.

---

## IV. Operational commands

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py test workshop inventory
```

```bash
node --test "workshop/tests/js/*.test.js"
```

Everything else — seeding, backups, the owner-identity commands, the SQLite→Postgres
copy — is in `CLAUDE.md` § Commands, which is the one place they are documented.

---

## V. The workspace

- **Core-only repository root**: application code, migrations and documented
  standards. Nothing else.
- **Environment isolation**: secrets live in `.env` — `SECRET_KEY`, the PostgreSQL
  credentials, the mail transport key. Owner *identity* deliberately does **not**:
  usernames, mobiles and email addresses are database rows.
- **Split settings**: `settings/` selects development or production via `DJANGO_ENV`,
  which has **no default** — an unset value raises `ImproperlyConfigured` rather than
  silently choosing a database.
- **Both environments run PostgreSQL** — development on a local instance, production
  on Railway's own Postgres in the same project as the app. SQLite is used only for bulk seeding
  (`USE_SQLITE=true`) and automatically for `manage.py test`.
- **Modular views**: the `workshop` app's views live in a `views/` package of **21
  focused modules**, with full backward compatibility via re-exports in `__init__.py`.
  **Fifteen** further modules hold **no views at all** and exist so that one rule has
  exactly one implementation — `analysis_engine`, `invoice`, `settlement`,
  `master_data`, `money`, `money_dates`, `spare_dates`, `return_to`, `delete_window`,
  `rent`, `photos`, `mileage`, `service_history`, `vehicle_ids`, `known_car`. See `CLAUDE.md` §
  Architecture.
- **One declaration per shared control**: `static/css/style.css` is the CSS side of
  that same rule, linked by `base.html` on every page — the "Record a Payment" card
  (`.rpay-*`), the back control (`.pg-back`), the question card (`.wcf-*`) and the
  phone-centring fix for every dialog all live there rather than being pasted a
  second time.
- **Deployment**: Railway (app + PostgreSQL in one project) behind
  `app.formuladservice.in`.

## VI. Roadmap

### Delivered

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Staff Registration** | `Mechanic.role` turned a mechanics-only table into one staff roster at `/manage/?section=staff`. Only Mechanic / Assistant Mechanic feed the job-card picker. |
| 2 | **Salary & Advance** | Advances recorded the day they happen, plus a month-end settlement that freezes salary / leave / advance / net into a `SalaryPaymentLine`. A settled month's figures never move afterwards. |
| 3 | **Estimates** | Quotations on the workshop's own letterhead, with a searchable history (`EST-26-001`). Built on `workshop/invoice.py`, so a quote and the bill that follows it cannot disagree. Deliberately connected to nothing else. |
| 4 | **Auth & notifications rebuild** | Delivered in six ordered phases so each left a working system: owner identity into the DB → Change Password → emailed reset code → login rebuilt → Control Hub locked to Owners → in-app feed. Web Push followed once the app was hosted. |
| 5 | **Owner Analysis rebuild** | The 7-zone placeholder system was deleted entirely and replaced with the two pages in §II.9. |
| 6 | **PostgreSQL migration** | Both environments. SQLite retained for exactly two jobs. |
| 7 | **Repo & docs cleanup** | Unreferenced files removed; every count in `MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md` re-derived from the code. **This is recurring, not finished** — the 2026-08-22 pass found the docs describing access rules the code had outgrown (the whole Supplier-Shops module and Control Hub had been tightened to Office/Owner while three docs still said Floor could reach them), a Trash-with-restore screen that no longer exists, a `CarModel.sample_image` field that never did, and six counts that had drifted (10 signal handlers reported as 8, 11 forms as 12, 16 `notify()` call sites as 18, 13 template filters as 12, 11 commands as 9, 30 models as 28). **Re-derive before quoting; do not trust a number because it is written down.**<br><br>The **2026-09-09 pass** proved the point again and found more than the August one: the architecture diagram and file tree in `MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md` had drifted on *ten* counts at once (30 models for 33, 18 view modules for 21, 123 routes for 136, 13 filters for 16, 11 commands for 14, 83 templates for 95, 71 migrations for 77, 49 test files for 64, 2,337 tests for 2,366, 14 events for 16), its closing **Total** line was stale on every single figure it carried, and **nine test files were documented nowhere**. Worse than any count: four docs still said an owner's `LOGIN` was INFO and reached no phone, which had been **reversed on 2026-08-29** — a security-relevant claim, stated confidently, and false. ⚠ **The lesson is the same one twice: a doc pass that only touches the sections a feature obviously belongs to will leave every number alone, and numbers are where these docs rot.** |
| 8 | **Photos** | Car photos on a saved job card, a box per Spare Parts row, and a read-only box on Purchase History. Storage is S3-compatible (Cloudflare R2, or Supabase as the no-card fallback), reached by the browser directly on presigned URLs — the app has no upload path and no media backend. Optional: with no credentials the section is simply absent. |
| 9 | **One origin, and a page that says it is loading** | Delivered 2026-08-21 as two commits. Every typed rupee amount now goes through `workshop/money.py` — the four payment screens had kept hand-rolled parsing, so `Infinity` settled a bill at an infinite receipt and 11 digits 500'd on Postgres. `GZipMiddleware` is on (211 KB → 55 KB on the job card form), which matters because `no-store` makes every page uncacheable. Every third-party asset is self-hosted from `static/vendor/`. And a 3px progress bar reports navigations, plus in-page updates that outlast 250 ms — the installed PWA is `display: standalone`, so it has no address bar or tab spinner of its own. Along the way: two JS tests that could never have passed now do, and a 300 ms debounce was removed from filter and pager taps. |

| 10 | **Owner Withdrawals** | Delivered 2026-08-31. Cash the owners take out for themselves had nowhere correct to go, and the likeliest place for it to land — the Cashbook — is the one place that breaks the profit figure, because `cashbook_expense()` feeds the equation. `OwnerWithdrawal` reaches exactly one figure in the whole engine, `cash_position()`'s money-out list, and nothing in `build_profit_report`. Owner-only end to end; both owners' totals printed and never netted; no edit, because delete is always available and every correction then lands in Deletion History. The same pass closed a defect in six screens: `parse_money` refuses a zero *before* it quantises, so `0.004` came back as `0.00` — a 500 on the three columns carrying a positive-amount constraint, and a zero-rupee row written on the one that does not. |

| 11 | **Deposit & Rent, and how far back money may be filed** | Delivered 2026-09-04. The workshop pays its rent in daily cash instalments to a collector who keeps his own book, and the office worked out what to hand over on paper every morning — `(target − paid) ÷ days left`. `/rent/` is that sum. **The rent and the deposits are two different numbers**: the rent is what a month COST, the deposits are how it gets PAID, and collapsing them would make monthly profit swing on a cash-flow decision. Nothing is stored but the rate and the deposits — no target column, no carry column — so one expression derives the pace, the carry-forward, a skipped day and a backdated rent change. Built for twenty years with **no cap and no pager**: one month of log, and history as collapsed year blocks. ⚠ It touched `analysis_engine` **nowhere** on delivery, deliberately — rent still reached the Profit page as a Cashbook category, so switching it on moved no reported figure by a rupee, and a test asserted that boundary so moving rent onto its own line would have to be a decision rather than a side effect.<br><br>The same pass closed the other end of the money-date range. `is_future()` had guarded one side for months; nothing guarded the other, and that is the quiet direction — a figure dated three years back rewrites a month nobody scrolls to. `money_dates.too_far_back()` floors **six** forms at the 1st of last month for Office (a **calendar month**, never a day count: a rolling 14 days breaks exactly when the office reconciles last month in the first days of this one). *(Superseded 2026-09-22: the floor is **three days** and covers seven screens — see the money-change rules above.)* Owners are unbound, because a go-live opening figure and an audit correction are legitimately older — so above that line prevention becomes **detection**: two CRITICAL events reach the *other* owner, and because an alert is a feed the actor never sees, a row keyed into a closed month now says so **on the row, permanently**. The Cashbook also asks before taking a wage, an owner's name or anything to do with rent, with the owner names read from `owner_accounts()` rather than hard-coded. |

| 11b | **Rent became the fifth expense stream** | Delivered 2026-09-04, and the workflow forced it rather than anybody choosing it. The boundary above held on one assumption about PEOPLE — that the office would keep keying the monthly rent bill into the Cashbook. Once they started recording rent in its own section instead, "no figure moves" quietly became **"rent is in the books nowhere"**: September 2026 carried ₹35,000 of real rent and the Profit page charged ₹900 of it, while May–August carried ₹45,000 Cashbook rows against a stored rate of ₹35,000 — two different rents in one system, neither page aware of the other. All Time was worse: it opened on 2026-02-07 against a ledger reaching back to October 2023, hiding **₹10,15,000** of rent while claiming to cover everything.<br><br>The split is now the app's **fourth instance** of a rule it already followed three times: what the month COST is the rate, charged in whole months → the expense; what was HANDED OVER is the deposits, by the day the cash moved → Cash Tracking; the gap → a position tile. The arithmetic lives in `rent.py` and the engine calls it, so the Profit page and the Deposit & Rent page cannot drift. ⚠ Rent is the **only stream that needs a cap**, because it is the only one not summed from rows — a 1 Jan – 31 Dec window would otherwise charge twelve months in September, ₹1,05,000 of expense that has not happened. A Cashbook category named like rent is now a double count and is **flagged, never filtered**, matched on word boundaries because this workshop calls its electricity bill "Current bill".<br><br>The same pass closed a **go-live defect** found on the way: `purge_business_data` — the command the runbook says to run against production — had never cleared `OwnerWithdrawal`, `RentRate` or `RentDeposit`, all three added after it was written. It reported success either way, leaving ₹12,60,000 of fabricated rent and ₹12,32,500 of fabricated cash out on the development data. Setting the rent from the go-live month is now an opening-balance step, because nothing on any screen looks broken without it. |

| 12 | **Service History, and every bill in one PDF** | Delivered 2026-09-06. The two things customers ask for, most often because they are **selling the car**, and both meant opening every job card, printing it one at a time and sending them one at a time. `/car-profiles/<reg>/invoices/` is the simpler half and its whole discipline is that it is **the same bill, not a copy that looks like one** — the markup was extracted into `includes/_invoice_sheet.html` the way the arithmetic already lived in `invoice.py`, and a test renders one card through both routes and asserts the sheets match character for character. A second template would have looked right on the day and drifted on some later one, and the *customer* would have found it holding both documents at once.<br><br>The service history is the one with the work in it: every visit newest-first as its own card, the **distance and days between them drawn in the join** rather than tabulated, and each part carrying `3  Wheel bearing left · 10,000 km · RUNNING` — a chain numbered from the first fitting, so `3` means the same thing whichever end you read from. Two foundations were needed. `mileage.py` reads `JobCard.mileage`, which is free text: an **allowlist of shapes, never a scrub**, because stripping non-digits turns `85000 2` into 850002 and `50000 miles` into a 60%-short interval — and it keeps what it cannot read exactly as typed, because it runs in `clean()` on every save and would otherwise delete a mechanic's note during an unrelated edit. `service_history.py` holds every figure and every name: gaps anchored to the **immediately previous** visit and never reaching past one with no reading, a chain named by its **commonest** spelling (the newest was tempting and wrong — the name is typed fresh every visit), averages over **completed lives only**, and due-soon at 0.9 of *this car's own* average, because the system holds no manufacturer schedules and inventing one would assert something nobody here agreed.<br><br>⚠ **The current reading is never stored.** The office asks "what is it showing now?" on the phone, and that answer makes every fitted part able to say how far it has run — but the workshop did not measure it, so writing it to `mileage` would poison the column every future interval is computed from. It rides in the query string and the sheet says *as told by the customer* on the line itself.<br><br>⚠ **The sheet also answers the buyer's own first question — how regularly the car has been serviced** (`SERVICED EVERY: 12,075 km · 317 days`), which a stack of invoices cannot without arithmetic on a kitchen table. It costs nothing: the gaps were already computed to be drawn in the joins. An implausible gap is left out of the DISTANCE and kept in the DAYS, and that asymmetry is the point — a mistyped odometer says nothing about two admission dates.<br><br>**THREE design passes, all the owner's**, and the third is the one worth reading. The first shipped wearing the invoice's letterhead over an **invented** design system — 7.5/8/8.5/9pt type, nine greys and two reds on no Formula D document — and read as generic; the rule became that nothing may use a size or colour the invoice does not already use, audited live at 0 off-palette of each. The second turned the visit card's body into a real table **on the invoice's own grid**. The third (2026-09-08) is the one that mattered, because **the first two rules were being obeyed and the sheet still looked wrong**. Measuring the two RENDERED documents element by element — rather than reading either stylesheet — found it: **the sheet was set in BOLD and the bill is not**, 166 bold elements against the bill's five, with eleven-point regular painted not once. So the head-of-file rule gained a third clause, WEIGHT, and the green that said "still fitted" thirty times went navy: **green means MONEY** in this system and this document carries no payment state at all. The same pass stopped the visit card saying everything twice (about thirty duplicated rows on a five-visit car), took the record block, its labels, its order and the whole foot from the bill line for line, and moved the notes to 8.5pt grey as the **one stated exception** to the size and colour rules — earned because it is the only block on the page that is not part of the RECORD. 3.20 pages to 2.63. |
| 13 | **One way out, one way to ask, one press** | Delivered 2026-09-05 → 09. Three UI-consistency defects the owner reported in the same breath as "all different look, different place, different design", each fixed by the rule this codebase already applies to arithmetic: **one declaration, not copies kept in step.**<br><br>**Back navigation** was 17 controls in 7 treatments across 2 placements — six byte-identical round buttons, three rebuilding the same geometry out of Bootstrap utilities, eight text links that agreed on the idea and disagreed on every value, one bare glyph, and four `javascript:history.back()` cancels. All now `.pg-back`, in its own row above the page header, **naming its destination** — because `start_url` is `/`, so on the first tap of a session a history button does nothing at all, and a control that sometimes does nothing is worse than no control. A **global** back button in the nav bar was asked for and deliberately **not built**: measured at 375px the bar is five equal 71px columns with no free slot, a sixth tab costs every existing tab 17%, and ~20 pages would then carry two back affordances. The spare shop's printed report was the app's one true dead end — it rendered **zero** anchors.<br><br>**Asking a question** was 21 native browser dialogs opening with "127.0.0.1:8000 says". All now the shared `.wcf-*` card. A card inherits the visibility rules of the screen it opens on, which caught a real defect on the way in: Mark Completed is pressed mostly from the Floor tablet and its card was explaining that the bill could still be settled afterwards — to somebody shown no money anywhere in this app. The same pass found `jobcard_edit` telling a mechanic to press an Unlock button that is not rendered for Floor.<br><br>**One press, one post** — reported from the shop. On a slow connection the same Confirm was tapped again and again and every tap was another POST: a payment deleted twice, an advance deleted twice. The app-wide guard listens for a submit EVENT and a programmatic `.submit()` fires none, so the nine dialogs posting that way were outside the rule entirely; `HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit` is wrapped in `confirm.js`. And **every dialog is now centred on a phone** — Bootstrap centres one only from 576px up, so each of the 18 carrying its own width sat pinned left, 4px out at 360px and 56px out at 412px, which is the width most of the workshop's handsets report. |
| 14 | **Chassis code & VIN, and a known plate fills the car** | Delivered 2026-09-15. Two optional boxes on the Job Card and the Estimate (`0078`): the chassis code says which platform a "320d" really is, the VIN proves which car it is. Every rule is `vehicle_ids.py` — a VIN is refused unless it is 17 letters and numbers with no I, O or Q, and there is deliberately **no check-digit test**, which would refuse the European cars this workshop services. Neither is printed on any customer document or chased at settlement. Typing a plate the workshop has seen fills the make, model, colour and both codes from that car's earlier visits (`known_car.py`); the last customer is only **offered** — greyed in, with a Use last visit button — because cars change hands, and only to Office and Owner, enforced in the lookup's answer rather than on the page. The same pass stopped the Car Profiles search shrinking a car's visit count, and removed a "Vehicles in Workshop" panel the job card form never rendered. |
| 15 | **Old Bills** | Delivered 2026-09-17. The workshop wrote about 800 bills in **Excel** before the system; `/old-bills/` is where they are typed in (`0079`), so each car's Profile, All Invoices and Service History reach back to its first visit. **Connected to nothing** — the Estimate rule applied to the past — and a test holds an allow-list of the only files that may mention the model, while adding the real sample bill is asserted to move no Profit, Cash or Position figure and no stock. It holds only what the paper shows: one date, no discount and no payment (the final figure was agreed verbally and never recorded), one mixed part list. The form reads in the paper's own order, the date is three typed boxes, **Enter never saves**, and the TOTAL is worked out rather than typed — the typist checks it against the XL bill (the owners' call, 2026-09-17, over a typed check that the system enforced). The browser and the server read typing from **one shared case file**. ⚠ **Excel used the system's own JB-YY-NNN numbers**, so `LAST_EXCEL_BILL_NUMBER` must be set on go-live day **before the first live job card** (runbook §3.5b), or the first live card reuses a number a customer already holds. On a Car Profile old bills are a yellow section numbered on their own, and the money tiles never include them; on the Service History they count in the car's history but not in TOTAL BILLED. Every sheet for a car without old bills was proved byte-identical before and after. |
| 16 | **Legacy Data — the go-live starting position** | Delivered 2026-09-19. The system goes live in a running workshop, so two Owner-only screens type the starting position once: **Opening Stock** (quantity and cost of one per product — a receipt that belongs to no shop, so it raises the shelf and creates no balance; always the first receipt in the costing replay; the cost is required, or parts fitted before the next bill would be charged ₹0 for good) and **Opening Balances** (what each shop's book says, saved exactly as typed — the person takes off any unassigned spares by hand, the owner's call over automatic subtraction). The balance joins each shop's cached total, so every screen follows, and payments pay it first in all three waterfalls; the shop page says how much is left until it reaches zero. **No profit or cash figure moves** (`analysis_engine.py` reads neither). The menu carries ONE Legacy Data row (the owner's call, 2026-09-20) whose page holds Old Bills and the two go-live screens. **At the end of go-live day an owner locks both from the page** (three red confirmations) — read-only for everyone, owners included, with nothing inside the app able to unlock them. The lock is a ROW (`0081`), not a host setting, so it travels with a restore or a move to another host — the owner's point, 2026-09-20; `manage.py unlock_legacy_data --yes` on the server is the only way back, and `LEGACY_DATA_LOCKED` remains as a spare. Migrations `0080` and `inventory/0010`; the go-live order and two "never do" rules are the runbook's §3.5 |
| 14b | **WhatsApp the customer from the invoice** | Delivered 2026-09-13. An owner gets a small WhatsApp icon on a bill whose card carries a real Indian mobile number. It opens that customer's chat, empty, and the owner attaches the PDF saved with Print and presses Send. It calls nothing and sends nothing — see §VII. |
| 17 | **Money-change rules, and Edit History** | Delivered 2026-09-22 and 2026-09-23, in two passes on the owners' own rules. **Pass 1:** Office dates money at most three days back and changes or deletes it only within 24 hours of keying it; owners are unlimited and every act is announced — the bell for anything Office may do, the other owner's phone for anything only an owner can. **Pass 2:** an edit is now KEPT, not only announced. `EditLog` — the **Edited** tab of Deletion History, one menu entry — records who changed which record and each money figure before → after, on all five edit doors. A notification is a feed swept 14 days after it is read, so until this nothing said what a figure used to be. No retention limit on either history: a row is a few hundred bytes, disputes surface months later, and GST expects years. ⚠ **Pass 2 sat agreed and unbuilt for a day with no row here** — noticed only because the owner asked. **Pass 3 (2026-09-24):** a **Back-dated** tab — money typed in on a later day than it moved, from seven tables, read off the two dates every row already keeps, so no new table; the three payment ledgers gained `recorded_by` so it can say who. And the **Cashbook went quiet inside Office's 24 hours**: its same-day edit or delete is the day's work (cash handed out, settled hours later), so it is neither kept nor announced; past the window, and any back-dating, still are. Rent was left for its own refactor (Pass 5). **Pass 4 (2026-09-24):** the page became **Change History** — one menu entry, three tabs, one row shape and one month at a time on all three, with nothing said twice on a row. A Legacy-Data-style hub was considered and not done: these are three views flipped between while reading, not three jobs done once. **Pass 5 (2026-09-24): Deposit & Rent refactored.** A deposit can now be **edited** (reversing "deliberately no edit") and follows the Cashbook's rule: an edit or delete inside Office's 24 hours is neither kept nor announced; past them — or a date moved past the three-day limit — only an owner can, and it is kept in Change History and reaches the other owner's phone. The page was rebuilt as four blocks, phone first: measured on a 375px phone, "₹1,300 paid ahead" was said twice and the deposit list started 594px down. The Record form stays the shared payment row that scrolls sideways — a two-line version was built and reverted the same day, the owners choosing one shape across all four payment cards. The row marks and the "Recently added" view went — Change History's Back-dated tab is the one place that trace lives. |
| 18 | **Warranty** | Delivered 2026-10-08, built 2026-10-02 → 10-08 on the owners' design. A customer comes back with a part that failed: a **warranty claim** opens a **warranty card** — a `JobCard` with `kind=WARRANTY` (`0088`), its own `WR-YY-NNN` series, ₹0 to the customer and never settled, held in `save()` on every save, so no screen can put money on one. **One claim is one part** (the owners, 2026-10-07): the car's warranty page lists every finished bill newest first — job cards, earlier warranty cards and Excel bills — and each part carries its own Claim button. The claimed part is copied linked to the exact part it replaces (`replaces` / `replaces_line`, `0089`), which is how a part reads "Being claimed" or "Replaced" and why a second failure is claimed on the replacement ("2nd claim"). **There is no claim for the work alone** — nothing ordered, nothing waits (the owners, 2026-10-08). **The warranty clock runs from the first bill and a claim never restarts it**, so a repeat claim's age and km count from where the part was first fitted. **The system never decides whether a part is covered**: it shows the age to the day and each part's shop, dates and shop price, and the owner decides. **The Shop Price is the shop's answer** — blank waiting, 0 free, an amount paid — so the Warranty page's "Waiting on the shop" and the Profit page need no new column. Cost is real money out and reaches the Profit page through the parts; the customer's side is in no bill list or average (`bill_cards()`). The paper is a **warranty slip** with no prices. Every rule is `workshop/warranty.py` |

### Open

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| 15 | **Hosting & go-live** | *In progress.* The system runs on Railway at a temporary URL; static serving, build commands and the email transport are done. **Remaining:** the production project on the Hobby plan under the workshop's own account, DNS for `app.formuladservice.in`, Resend domain verification, Cloudflare, and the go-live steps. Procedure: `GO_LIVE_RUNBOOK.md`. |
| 16 | **Deep debug pass** | The serious pre-handover sweep, to run once everything is wired on the real infrastructure. |
| 17 | **Frontend polish** | Ongoing. Raise the visual/UX bar to match the backend's rigor. |
| 18 | **Stability / security / performance / code-quality hardening** | Ongoing across both apps. |
| 19 | **Keep every financial and security rule under test** | Not a coverage percentage. The existing tests already cover the money and the access rules, which is where the risk is; chasing a number buys tests for template rendering and Django's own internals. **Add a test when a rule is added or a bug is fixed, not to move a metric.** |

### Carried into go-live

Three items are verified-open and belong to the go-live sequence rather than to
development:

- **Push and the PWA install banner need re-testing on the real domain.**
  Registration, install state and subscriptions are per-origin, so every device must
  re-enable push after the move regardless. Steps: `GO_LIVE_RUNBOOK.md`.
- **Resend delivery must be confirmed before go-live, not after.** Password reset is
  the *only* self-service recovery an owner has. `AUD-0090` in `TECH_DEBT.md`.
- **Mobile type scale** — correct in the browser's device emulator, reported as too
  small on a real phone. This is a **design decision, not a bug**; measurements have
  been taken and the owner is answering it screen by screen.

- **DONE (2026-08-21): the app no longer loads anything from a third party.**
  It previously pulled Bootstrap's CSS, its icon font and its JS bundle from
  `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, Chart.js from the same, and the Barlow families from
  `fonts.googleapis.com` — 16 references across 14 templates, **none carrying an
  `integrity=` attribute**. All of it is now served from `static/vendor/`, at the
  exact versions those tags were pinned to.

  Recorded because the reasoning outlives the change:

  1. *Availability.* The HTML arrives from our own origin while a subresource
     fails, so the page rendered BROKEN rather than not at all — unstyled if the
     CSS dropped, and with the drawer, every modal and every ⋮ dropdown dead if
     the JS dropped. Narrower than "flaky wifi": it needed our origin to work
     while jsdelivr specifically did not, which is what a **cold cache on go-live
     day** looks like — the one day every device in the workshop loads the app for
     the first time.
  2. *Supply chain.* With no SRI, a compromised CDN would have executed arbitrary
     JavaScript on every page, including the settle screen. SRI was considered and
     rejected: it fixes tampering while making availability slightly worse, since
     a mismatched file is blocked outright.

  It costs nothing at runtime — WhiteNoise serves them content-hashed and
  pre-compressed, so after the first visit they are free, and two third-party
  origins leave the critical path.

  ⚠ **The Railway Build Command is now load-bearing.** `collectstatic` is not in
  the `Procfile`; it is a Build Command set by hand per project
  (`GO_LIVE_RUNBOOK.md` §1.2), and it does **not** travel with the repo. Without
  it these assets are never collected and the manifest storage 500s every page.
  It is set on the throwaway demo project; **the real production project needs it
  set again**, along with the Pre-Deploy `migrate`.

  Nothing here is hand-edited — `scratchpad/vendor_assets.py` refetches the lot,
  the same rule `build_app_icons.py` follows.

One product question is still owed to the owner: **master-list rename/merge could be
replaced with delete-only plus click-through** to the job cards using an entry.
`AUD-0085` and the note in `TECH_DEBT.md` carry the trade.

## VII. Deliberately out of scope

This system is built for one workshop, to that workshop's actual working rhythm. The
following are **not missing features** — each was considered and left out. They will
be built only if the client asks.

| Not built | Why |
|---|---|
| **GST / tax invoicing** — *coming back into scope* | Nothing in billing carries a tax field, an HSN code or a GSTIN today, because the workshop has not billed under GST. ⚠ **That is changing (2026-09-13):** Formula D is registering, and GST will be built once the owners send the details — GSTIN, rates, invoice format. It is planned work waiting on them, no longer out of scope. |
| **Customer-facing notifications** (SMS / WhatsApp / email to car owners) | The app makes two kinds of outbound call, both for the owners' own accounts. Do not add a messaging integration. *The invoice's WhatsApp icon is not one: it only opens the customer's chat — it calls nothing and sends nothing, and the owner attaches the PDF and presses Send.* |
| **Attendance tracking** | Leave days are typed once per person at month-end settlement. For six or seven staff that is less work than maintaining a daily record. |
| **Multi-mechanic assignment** | A job card has one `lead_mechanic`. Work is assigned verbally on the floor; the card records who owns the job, not everyone who touched it. |
| **General file attachments** (PDFs, documents on a job card) | Photos are a camera workflow with a fixed shape and a hard count limit. An open attachment store is a different problem with different retention, virus-scanning and naming questions. |

> **For reviewers — human or AI:** proposing any of the above is proposing **scope**,
> not reporting a defect. If a review flags one as "missing", the correct response is
> to point here. The same applies to the frontend-architecture decision in
> `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## VIII. Working conventions — the "Titan" creed

1. **Fix the code, not the tests.** If a test fails, the logic is likely wrong. Never
   bypass a security test.
2. **Every new rule gets a test.** One honest exception: the Django suite executes no
   JavaScript. `node --test "workshop/tests/js/*.test.js"` covers one deliberately DOM-free
   module; everything else in the frontend must be verified by hand in the browser on
   the page it touches. Treat that as a reason to keep JS changes small — **not** as a
   reason to add a build toolchain.
3. **Industrial-grade aesthetics.** No placeholders, no generic colours. The UI must
   match the premium quality of the backend, and must work on all three devices.
4. **State what is true.** Overstated or unverified claims — performance numbers with
   no benchmark, counts nobody recounted — undermine the doc's credibility. This is
   what let these docs drift stale before.
5. **Keep docs in sync in the same session.** New model/field, new route, new workflow,
   roadmap item completed → update the owning doc. The ownership map is in `CLAUDE.md`.

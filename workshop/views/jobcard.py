    Make the payment state honest again after an unlocked edit moved the bill on
    an already-settled card.

    The Financial Lock exists because editing a settled card is a real need, not
    an accident — but nothing used to follow the money afterwards, and the two
    settlement routes fail in opposite directions:

      PAID (walk-in) — `discount_amount` stayed at whatever the original
        settlement computed, so the Profit page kept reading revenue as
        `bill − discount` off the NEW bill while `received_amount` never moved.
        Adding a ₹500 part to a ₹1,000 card settled at ₹800 turned ₹800 of
        turnover into ₹1,300, ₹500 of it never earned by anyone. A walk-in has
        exactly one payment event (see CLAUDE.md), so the shortfall *is* the
        discount — recomputing it is that rule applied to the new total, and it
        restores `bill − discount == received`. A large jump trips the existing
        HIGH_DISCOUNT alert (raised by `jobcard_edit` through
        `billing.announce_high_discount` — this function raised nothing until
        2026-09-22, while saying it did) and shows up in `audit_high_discounts`, which is
        precisely the compensating control for it.

      BULK_PAID (fleet) — a fleet genuinely does pay later, so the extra is not
        a discount, it is owed. But `bulk_payer_pay` only cascades over
        PENDING/PARTIAL cards, so a BULK_PAID card whose bill grew was skipped
        forever: the fleet page showed "₹0 outstanding across 0 cards" while
        `get_pending_balance` said ₹500, and paying another ₹500 parked it as
        advance credit instead of clearing the card. Dropping it back to
        PARTIAL puts it in front of the cascade again.

    A bill that shrank below what was received is left alone in both cases —
    that is an overpayment, not a shortfall, and inventing a refund here would

    POST data with every Office-only field forced back to what is already stored.

    Renamed from `_price_locked_data` on 2026-08-16, when the customer's name and
    number joined the prices behind the same gate. The rule it enforces was never
    about money as such: **a field Floor cannot see on any screen must be a field
    Floor cannot post from any screen.** A helper called "price locked" that also
    pins a phone number is precisely the drift this codebase keeps records to
    avoid.

    Prices are hidden from Floor in the template, but the inputs are still
    rendered — inside a `d-none` cell — because leaving them out would make the
    formset save blanks over what Office entered. That left the rule enforced in
    the UI only: a Floor login POSTing `total_price=1` turned a ₹5,000 bill into
    ₹1, and the same hole existed in the Spare Parts section long before the
    Inventory one was added.

    Dropping a FORMSET field is not an option (it wipes the row), so each is
    overwritten with the value on the existing row: a crafted POST simply has no
    effect. Rows with no stored counterpart get blank, since a Floor user has no
    prices to preserve on a part they are adding.

    Three groups, and only the first is a formset:

      1. the per-part prices, in the `spares` and `inventory` prefixes;
      2. `labour_amount`, the whole labour charge, which lives on the job card;
      3. `customer_name` / `customer_contact`, which live there too.

    Groups 2 and 3 are fields on the CARD, so the returned data has to be what
    binds `JobCardForm` as well as the formsets — binding the form from raw
    `request.POST` would leave exactly those unprotected. Unlike a formset field
    they can also safely be left out of the template for Floor: an absent field
    on a ModelForm leaves the stored value alone, which is why the template omits

         EVERY shop the rows touched, old and new alike, has its totals

    The job card, read only. OFFICE AND OWNER ONLY.

    It was `@staff_required` until 2026-08-18 and Floor really could reach it —
    by URL, and by the "View" button in the Vehicles-in-Workshop sidebar on the
    new-job-card screen, which is a Floor page. What kept that honest was a pile
    of gates INSIDE the template hiding the customer and every figure.

    Closing the door replaces all of them, and the reason is the layout rather
    than the secrecy. The page is now three lines of identity and four lists,
    with no labels — the owner's own design, and it only works because position
    carries the meaning. Line 2 runs mileage, mechanic, customer and phone
    number into one comma-separated line, and every part sets the workshop's
    COST beside the customer's price. There is no version of either that is safe
    to show a mechanic with some words removed: what Floor would get is a line
    with holes in it and a parts list where the figures sometimes appear, which
    is worse than not having the page.

    FLOOR LOSES NOTHING IT CANNOT GET SOMEWHERE BETTER. The dashboard car card's
    live-details drawer is these same four lists, on the board Floor works from
    all day, and the job card itself is still `@staff_required`. The one
    Floor-visible link is gated in the same edit that closed this view, which is
    the `InvoiceLinkVisibilityTests` rule: a template gate must mirror its view's
    decorator, in both directions — a door Floor can see but not open is worse
    than no door.

    What each part PRINTS is built here too, by `_describe_spare` — "join the
    values that exist", which a template does as a chain of `{% if %}`s that has
    to get every separator right, and gets wrong on the row with no shop. The
    identity line's separators are the one exception and are drawn in CSS

    The card's three dates, ready to print: admitted, completed, settled.

    THE THIRD IS CALLED **SETTLED**, NOT "BILLED", AND THE WORD IS THE POINT.
    `paid_date` is written only when `payment_status` becomes PAID/BULK_PAID, so
    it is the day the money was taken — and "billed" already means something else
    on a screen an owner reads in the same sitting: Deep Analysis calls a
    Supplies Shop purchase "billed" precisely BECAUSE it is not yet a cost. There
    is no separate bill-issue date on a job card to point at either: the bill
    exists from the moment the card does, since `bill_number` is assigned on
    first save. So a stage called "Billed" would either restate the admitted date
    or quietly mean settled. It means settled, so it says settled — the same word
    the lock chip on this page and the settle dialog already use.

    ALL THREE ARE ALWAYS RETURNED, with `date=None` where nothing has happened
    yet, and the page prints a dash there. A fixed structure is what makes this
    page learnable, the same rule that keeps an empty section drawn rather than
    omitted.

    The third one earns its column on FLEET cards. A walk-in has exactly one
    payment event and it happens at pickup, so settled and completed are the same
    day and the column repeats — but a fleet collector comes round weeks or
    months later against several months of cars, and those are the largest single
    receipts the workshop takes. That is the case worth having a column for, and
    it is precisely the case the demo seeders flatten: all three of them write
    `paid_date` from `completed_date`, so no measurement taken against seeded
    data can say anything about this.

    Each date is read from its OWN column and never inferred from the one before
    it, so a card that reached a state out of order still prints honestly rather
    than the page inventing a sequence the data does not support.

    How long this car has been here, as one ready phrase — or None when there

    The page prints TWO dates, admitted and completed, and the fact worth having
    between them is the one neither of them states: the gap. An owner reading
    "06/06/2026" and "08/06/2026" is doing subtraction to answer "how long did we
    hold this car", which is the question they actually opened the card with.

    ONLY TWO DATES, DELIBERATELY. `paid_date` is tracked and is NOT shown here:
    measured over the 150 settled cards in the demo set, 149 of them were settled
    on the very day they were completed, so a third date would print the same
    number twice on all but one card — the rule the money line at the foot of
    this page already follows. What the payment side needs is a STATE, not a
    date, and the chip down there already carries it.

    An OPEN card counts to today and says so ("12 days in"), because a car still
    on the floor is the case where the number is actually changing and worth
    watching. `localdate()`, never `date.today()`: the server can run in UTC
    while the workshop works in IST, and near midnight the two disagree about
    which day it is — which on a counter that starts at "Today" would be a
    visible off-by-one.

    Nothing is returned when the arithmetic would be nonsense: no admitted date,
    or a completion dated before the admission. A negative day count is a typo
    somewhere upstream, and printing "-3 days" would make this page the one that
    looks broken rather than the data.

    Everything the read-only card prints about one part, as three ready strings
    on the object: `meta_line`, `cost_str` and `price_str`.

    Three rather than one because the page puts them in different places — the
    facts read left-to-right under the part's name, the two figures sit
    right-aligned in their own column so they form a line you can run an eye
    down, and the cost is drawn quieter than the price. Joined into a single
    string they ran together as "10/07/2026 – 10/07/2026 · ₹5,727 – ₹7,967",
    where the eye had to find the ₹ to know where the dates stopped. That is
    what the owner asked to have fixed.

    Built here rather than in the template because a template doing this ends up
    as a chain of `{% if %}`s that has to get every separator right, and gets it
    wrong on the row with no shop. No captions in any of them — that is the
    page's whole rule.

    THE TWO ROUTES DIFFER, and the difference is the `source` rule this codebase
    keeps everywhere. A warehouse draw came off the shelf already fitted: no
    shop, no order, no arrival, so it has no dates and no supplier. It also
    prints ONE figure, because its `unit_price` is the warehouse average PER

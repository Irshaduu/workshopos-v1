"""
What a car's SERVICE HISTORY prints — one module, no views, no HTTP.

The third customer document, after the invoice and the estimate, and the first
that describes a CAR rather than a visit. It is handed over when a customer
asks for their record — most often because they are SELLING the car — so every
figure on it will be read by somebody with no reason to give the workshop the
benefit of the doubt, beside a stack of invoices they can check it against.

Same shape as `invoice.py`, and it depends on that module rather than
paraphrasing it. `part_display_name`, `effective_quantity` and `document_title`
are imported, never restated: a part named one way on the bill and another way
here is the workshop contradicting itself in a folder where both documents sit
together.

**THE THING THIS DOCUMENT DOES THAT NOTHING ELSE IN THE APP DOES: IT FOLLOWS A
PART ACROSS VISITS.** A wheel bearing fitted three times over four years is
three rows on three job cards and nothing joins them up. Here they are one
chain, numbered from the first time this car ever had that part, each carrying
the distance it covered before it was replaced:

    3  Wheel Bearing - Left    10,000 km   RUNNING
    2  Wheel Bearing - Left    12,800 km
    1  Wheel Bearing - Left    13,000 km

That is the answer to "how long does this part last on THIS car", and it is
worth more to a buyer than any single invoice. It costs nothing but ordering:
every figure is one stored reading minus another.

⚠ **EACH VISIT'S AMOUNT IS `total_bill_amount` — WHAT THE INVOICE SAID — AND
ANY DISCOUNT IS PRINTED UNDER IT.** Both halves are deliberate.

  * The amount stays the invoice's own TOTAL, so a customer checking one visit
    against the paper they were handed never finds a disagreement.
  * **The discount is printed, by the owners' decision (2026-09-11).** Formula
    D gives one to every customer on purpose and the owners want it seen: it
    reminds the customer what they were given, and it stops a later buyer
    reading the lifetime figure as a workshop that overcharges. This REVERSES
    what this module held until then — "the discount itself is never
    printed", on `settlement()`'s reasoning that it is a write-off agreed at
    the counter and printing it invites renegotiation. That reasoning is still
    why the INVOICE prints none; a history is read months later, when there is
    nothing left to renegotiate.
  * ⚠ **The gap must be NAMED.** Two unlabelled figures side by side — ₹25,000
    and ₹23,000 — read to a stranger as ₹2,000 still OWED: a false debt, on the
    one document handed to people with no reason to give the workshop the
    benefit of the doubt. One word, DISCOUNT, is the whole fix.
  * ⚠ **The closing figure is NET, never PAID.** A discount exists only on a
    settled card (the shortfall-is-the-discount rule), so per visit PAID would
    be true — but the lifetime total also counts completed visits nobody has
    paid for yet, and "TOTAL PAID" would claim that money as well.

`net_total` is `total_billed − total_discount`, both summed from the visit rows
printed above them, so the closing block adds up from the page.
`car_profile_detail` counts the same completed visits and prints TOTAL BILLED
and DISCOUNT as these same figures; NET TOTAL is its Paid + Still owed.

**NO PAYMENT STATE APPEARS ANYWHERE.** This is a record of WORK, not of debt. A
discount is not payment state — it is what the workshop took off the bill —
and nothing here reads `received_amount` or `payment_status`.

Nothing here is a money source of truth; every amount is the job card's own
denormalized column, read the way every other screen reads it.

**OLD BILLS — the Excel bills from before the system — are part of the car's
HISTORY and not of its money.** They join the chain in date order, so part life,
the gaps, SERVICED EVERY, the distance and the first visit all see the car's
whole life here. They print as OLD BILL 1, 2, 3 — numbered on their own, so no
VISIT number moves — and they are kept OUT of TOTAL BILLED, DISCOUNT and NET
TOTAL, which stay the figures the Car Profile prints. Their billed total is its
own figure: their discounts were agreed at the counter and never recorded.

    """
    Everything the service history sheet renders, derived from a car's cards.

    Takes every job card for one registration — not a pre-filtered list — so
    that WHICH VISITS COUNT is decided here, once, and can be tested without a
    request. Same division of labour as `build_invoice`: the caller resolves
    the records and prefetches, this returns plain values, the template prints
    them.

    The caller is expected to have prefetched `labours`, `concerns` and
    `spares` (with `item__category` selected). Nothing here works around a
    missing prefetch; it simply costs queries, exactly as on the invoice.

    `current_km` is what the customer said on the phone. It is **never
    stored** — it arrives as a query parameter and leaves with the page,
    because it is one person's word on one day and the workshop did not measure
    it. It changes exactly one class of figure: how far the parts currently on
    the car have run.

    **Three rules about which visits appear, each of which changes a figure:**

    * **Deleted cards are out.** Every consumer in the app filters them.
    * **Only COMPLETED visits are listed.** A car still on the floor has parts
      being added to it and a total that is not final, so including it would
      put a figure on a customer's document that changes after they were handed
      it. The count of open visits is reported instead, and the sheet says so.
    * **Sorted OLDEST FIRST here and printed NEWEST FIRST.** Both directions
      are needed and they are not interchangeable: a part's chain and a visit's
      gap can only be built in the direction time runs, while the sheet leads
      with the most recent visit because that is the one being asked about.
      `pk` breaks a same-day tie — `admitted_date` is a DateField and several
      cars share a date, so without it the order inside a day is whatever the
      database returns, which differs between PostgreSQL and SQLite.

    `old_bills` are the car's Excel bills (prefetched `job_lines` and
    `part_lines`). They join the history in date order and stay out of the
    money totals — see the module docstring.

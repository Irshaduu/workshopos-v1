# Go-Live Runbook — WorkshopOS (Titan)

**What this is:** the ordered steps to put this system into real use at Formula
D, written to be followed rather than remembered. Tick items off as you go.

**Who it is for:** the person doing the deployment. It assumes no prior
production experience and states the reason for each step, because a step whose
purpose you understand is one you can recover from.

**The one rule:** if a step fails, stop and read the error. Do not run the next
step hoping it clears. Every destructive command here has a dry run — use it.

**Its companion:** `RAILWAY_OPERATIONS.md` is the ongoing reference — creating
the project, the full variable table, shipping updates after go-live, backups,
costs, maintenance and troubleshooting. This file is the one-time procedure;
that one is what you come back to.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Target host** | Railway (Hobby plan) |
| **Target database** | Railway PostgreSQL, same project |
| **App URL** | `app.formuladservice.in` |
| **Mail** | Resend HTTPS API, sending from `mail.formuladservice.in` |
| **Public website** | `formuladservice.in` — WordPress, **not touched by any of this** |

---

## Part 0 — Understand the shape of the change

Two things people expect to happen here, which do **not**:

- **The demo data does not move.** You are not migrating the development database.
  The real system starts with an empty database and the workshop's real
  opening figures. Copying demo data across and then deleting it leaves far
  more room for a mistake than never copying it.
- **The public website is not involved.** Adding `app.` and `mail.` subdomains
  adds two lines to a DNS table. It edits nothing that already exists. If you
  deleted both lines afterwards, `formuladservice.in` would not notice.

---

## Part 1 — Before the day

Do these whenever. None need the owners or DNS access.

### 1.1 Rehearse a database restore ☐

**Do this first, and do not skip it.** A backup nobody has restored is not a
backup — it is a file you hope about. The original audit logged the restore as
untested (AUD-0063); that entry left `TECH_DEBT.md` because this step now
carries it.

```bash
python manage.py backup_db
```

Then restore that file into a scratch database (not the live one) and compare
row counts against the source. The file extension tells you which tool to use:

| Extension | Restore with |
|---|---|
| `.dump` | `pg_restore` |
| `.sql` | `psql` |
| `.sqlite3` | file copy |

Write down the exact command that worked, in section 5.2 below. You want it in
front of you on the day you need it, not in your head.

### 1.2 Railway: build and deploy commands ☐

The `Procfile` only defines `web:`, so nothing currently runs `collectstatic`
or `migrate`. This is why the test deployment served no CSS or JavaScript.

⚠ **This setting is now load-bearing, and it does NOT travel with the repo — it
is set per project, by hand.** Since 2026-08-21 every frontend asset is served
from `static/vendor/` rather than a CDN (Bootstrap, its icon font, Chart.js, the
Barlow families). Combined with the manifest storage that means a missing
`collectstatic` no longer degrades the styling — **it 500s every page**, because
`{% static %}` raises when an entry is absent from the manifest. Confirm this
field on the real production service even if you remember setting it on the demo
one.

Railway dashboard → service → **Settings**:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Build Command | `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` |
| Pre-Deploy Command | `python manage.py migrate --noinput` |
| Start Command | `gunicorn formulad_workshop.wsgi:application` |
| **Region (Settings -> Scale)** | **Southeast Asia (Singapore)** — on BOTH services |
| Serverless | OFF |

Pre-deploy is the correct home for migrations: it runs once before the new
version takes traffic, rather than on every restart of every replica. It is
behind the **"+ Add pre-deploy step"** link under Custom Start Command, not a
labelled field of its own.

⚠ **THE REGION IS THE SINGLE LARGEST SPEED DECISION ON THIS PAGE, AND RAILWAY
DEFAULTS IT WRONG FOR THIS WORKSHOP.** The default is US East (Virginia), ~200ms
from Kerala against Singapore's ~50ms, and every page here is a full navigation
over a `no-store` response — so the distance is paid on every tap. Measured on a
rehearsal deployment: most pages went **3.5x-4.5x faster** on the same code and
the same empty database. See `RAILWAY_OPERATIONS.md` §2.4b for the numbers.

**Set it on the app AND on Postgres.** Split across two regions is worse than
leaving both alone. Do it before there is real data — moving Postgres migrates
its volume and takes brief downtime.

### 1.3 Railway: environment variables ☐

```
DJANGO_ENV=production          ← without this the app refuses to boot, by design
SECRET_KEY=<a fresh one>       ← NOT the value from your local .env
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=app.formuladservice.in
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://app.formuladservice.in
BUSINESS_NAME=Formula D
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=Formula D <noreply@mail.formuladservice.in>
RESEND_API_KEY=<from Resend, section 2.3>
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY / VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY / VAPID_ADMIN_EMAIL
DB_NAME / DB_USER / DB_PASSWORD / DB_HOST / DB_PORT
DB_SSLMODE=prefer
OWNER_1_USERNAME / OWNER_1_MOBILE   ← each owner's username exactly as you will
OWNER_2_USERNAME / OWNER_2_MOBILE     create it in §3.3; read only by sync_owner_identity

PHOTO_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID / PHOTO_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / PHOTO_S3_BUCKET
PHOTO_S3_ACCOUNT_ID            ← Cloudflare R2 only; host is derived from it
                                 (for any other provider use PHOTO_S3_ENDPOINT
                                  + PHOTO_S3_REGION + PHOTO_S3_PATH_PREFIX)

LAST_EXCEL_BILL_NUMBER         ← leave blank until §3.5b, on the day itself
LEGACY_DATA_LOCKED             ← optional spare lock; the lock owners press lives
                                 in the database (§3.5 step 6)
```

Generate the secret key:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"
```

Notes that will save you time:

- **`DB_SSLMODE=prefer`, not `require`.** The default in `base.py` is `require`,
  which suited a hosted database reached over the public internet and suits
  nothing in use today. Railway's Postgres is reached over its private network
  where TLS may not be offered, and `require` then fails to connect. (Local
  development sets `disable` for the same reason, one step further.) `prefer` uses TLS when available and plain when not; the traffic
  never leaves Railway's own network either way.
- **Use the Railway-provided `PG*` variables** to fill `DB_*` — reference them
  rather than pasting values, so a credential rotation does not silently break
  the app.
- **Never regenerate the VAPID keys.** Doing so invalidates every push
  subscription and every device has to re-enable push by hand.
- **The photo variables are optional and fail safe.** With none of them set the
  photo section is simply absent and everything else on the job card behaves
  identically — so a missing bucket cannot block go-live. But **do not leave them
  half-set**: production must resolve to either a real bucket or nothing. It can
  never fall back to local disk (that is gated on `DEBUG`, deliberately, because
  Railway's filesystem is wiped on every deploy). See §2.6.

### 1.4 Redeploy and check the browser console ☐

Open the app, then DevTools → Console and Network.

- ☐ No 404s under `/static/`
- ☐ Filenames look like `script.4950246ea5b3.js` (content-hashed)
- ☐ No "Refused to apply style" or "Refused to execute script" errors
- ☐ `/robots.txt` returns the disallow file
- ☐ Any page returns the header `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`

If static files still 404, the build command did not run — check the deploy log
for the `collectstatic` output before changing anything else.

### 1.5 Confirm production settings are really in force ☐

Visit a URL that does not exist, e.g. `/definitely-not-a-page`.

- ☐ You see the app's own styled 404 page
- ☐ You do **not** see Django's yellow debug traceback

A debug traceback in production leaks settings, file paths and SQL. If you see
one, `DJANGO_ENV` or `DEBUG` is wrong — fix it before going further.

---

## Part 2 — With the owners (DNS)

### 2.1 Record what exists before changing it ☐

Ask for access to the DNS panel for `formuladservice.in`, then:

- ☐ **Screenshot every existing record.** This is your undo.
- ☐ Note whether any `MX` record exists (mail for the domain)
- ☐ Note any existing `TXT` record starting `v=spf1`

If mail already exists on the domain, that is fine — you are working on the
`mail.` subdomain and will not touch it. But know before you type.

### 2.2 Add two records ☐

Nothing existing is edited or removed.

| Type | Name | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| CNAME | `app` | *(Railway gives you this)* | the workshop system |
| TXT ×3 | `mail` | *(Resend gives you these)* | SPF / DKIM for sending |

### 2.3 Resend ☐

- ☐ Create an account
- ☐ Add domain — enter **`mail.formuladservice.in`**, *not* `formuladservice.in`
- ☐ Add the DNS records it shows, wait for it to report Verified
- ☐ Create an API key, put it in Railway as `RESEND_API_KEY`

**Why the subdomain matters:** SPF/DKIM records added at the root can disturb
mail for the business domain itself, now or whenever the owners set up a
`@formuladservice.in` address. On `mail.` they are isolated and cannot.

### 2.4 Railway custom domain ☐

Railway → Settings → Networking → Add `app.formuladservice.in`. The HTTPS
certificate is issued automatically; it can take a few minutes.

- ☐ `https://app.formuladservice.in` loads with a valid padlock

**Do not** submit `formuladservice.in` to the HSTS preload list. `production.py`
sends the `preload` directive, which is inert unless you submit it — submitting
would force HTTPS on the WordPress site too and could break it.

### 2.5 Cloudflare in front of the app ☐

**This is the single most effective security measure on the list, and it costs
nothing.** The app is a private business system with five known users sitting on
the public internet. Every in-app control — the lockout, the password rules —
fights the guesser *after* they have reached Django. Cloudflare stops them
arriving. Nothing in the application changes.

Do this **after** §2.2–2.4 are verified, not before. Moving nameservers while
also waiting on Resend's SPF/DKIM verification is two variables at once, and you
will not know which one is failing. Cloudflare imports the existing records when
you add the domain, so the order costs nothing.

- ☐ Add `formuladservice.in` to Cloudflare (free plan)
- ☐ **Check the imported record list against the §2.1 screenshots, line by
  line.** The WordPress site on the root domain rides on these too — an import
  that quietly dropped a record takes the business's public website down, not
  just the app.
- ☐ Change the nameservers at the registrar, wait for Cloudflare to report Active
- ☐ Confirm the WordPress site still loads, before touching anything else
- ☐ SSL/TLS mode → **Full (strict)**
- ☐ `app` record → proxy **ON** (orange cloud)
- ☐ Security → Bot Fight Mode → on
- ☐ Rate limiting rule: path contains `/login`, 10 requests per minute per IP

Then the four things that actually bite:

- ☐ **`https://app.formuladservice.in` still loads.** If you get an infinite
  redirect loop, SSL/TLS mode is on *Flexible* — Cloudflare talks HTTP to
  Railway, Django's `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` sends it back to HTTPS, forever. Full
  (strict) is the fix.
- ☐ **Sign in and read the IP in the resulting login notification.** It must be a
  real public address. If it is a Cloudflare IP, a `100.64.x.x`, or the same
  constant on every sign-in, then `workshop/client_ip.py` is reading a proxy —
  and `FailedAttempt` is counting *everybody's* failures into one row, so 20
  fumbles from anyone would lock out the whole workshop. On Railway alone this
  was measured and fixed on 2026-09-21 (AUD-0107): `REMOTE_ADDR` is Railway's
  internal proxy, and the first `X-Forwarded-For` value is the real visitor,
  set by Railway. Behind Cloudflare the fix is to read `CF-Connecting-IP`,
  which is safe **only** because Cloudflare overwrites it on every request —
  change `client_ip.py` and nothing else, since everything reads it.
- ☐ **Check this before Cloudflare too**, at §1.4 — Railway has its own edge, so
  this may already be true today and Cloudflare would only be inheriting it.
- ☐ Push notifications still arrive (the origin has not changed, so they should)

**Do not** turn on "Under Attack" mode or a country restriction as a default.
Both will lock out an owner travelling, at a moment when you are the only person
who can lift it.

### 2.6 Photo storage bucket ☐

Optional — skip the whole section and the photo feature is simply absent. If the
owners want it:

- ☐ Create a **production bucket, separate from the development one.** They are
      free, and one shared bucket means a purge run on a laptop can reach real
      photographs.
- ☐ Create an access key scoped to that bucket, and set the `PHOTO_S3_*`
      variables from §1.3.
- ☐ **Set the bucket's CORS policy** — without it every upload fails:

  | Setting | Value |
  |---|---|
  | `AllowedOrigins` | `https://app.formuladservice.in` |
  | `AllowedMethods` | `PUT`, `GET` |
  | `AllowedHeaders` | `content-type` |

- ☐ Redeploy, open a saved job card, take one photo, reload the page, confirm it
      is still there.

**Two things that will cost you an hour if you skip them.** A missing CORS policy
fails in the browser in a way that reads exactly like a **signing** bug — check
CORS first. And **Cloudflare R2 requires a payment card even on its free tier**;
if the owners' card is not available on the day, **Supabase Storage** speaks the
same S3 protocol and needs no code change — set `PHOTO_S3_ENDPOINT`,
`PHOTO_S3_REGION` and `PHOTO_S3_PATH_PREFIX` instead of `PHOTO_S3_ACCOUNT_ID`.

**Retention is not scheduled by default.** `purge_old_photos` drops photographs
older than a year (never from an unpaid bill). At this workshop's volume the
bucket plateaus around 2 GB inside a 10 GB free tier, so there is no hurry —
decide with the owners rather than automating it now.

---

## Part 3 — The day

Order matters here. Read the whole part before starting.

### 3.1 Prepare the database ☐

Starting empty, on Railway Postgres:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py setup_groups
python manage.py load_master_data
```

- ☐ `migrate` reports no errors
- ☐ `setup_groups` prints all three roles — Owner, Office, Floor

**`migrate` already creates all three roles**, through a `post_migrate` hook in
`workshop/apps.py` — checked on 2026-09-15 by migrating an empty database, which
came out holding Floor, Office and Owner. **`setup_groups` is the repair**, and it
is still worth running here: it is safe to re-run (`get_or_create` touches nothing
that already exists, and it never removes a group or moves anybody between them),
and it puts the roles back on a database that has lost them.

⚠ **It created the wrong groups until 2026-09-06** — worth knowing because it is the
shape of failure this whole runbook exists to catch. It created `Workers` and `Admins`,
two groups nothing in this codebase reads, left over from an RBAC model the app
has not used in a long time. It failed in the worst possible direction: **this
runbook's own checklist claimed it created Owner / Office / Floor**, and Control
Hub refuses to create an Office or Floor login with the role row missing and
tells you to *"Run `manage.py setup_groups` to restore the Owner/Office/Floor
roles"*. So the documented remedy and the on-screen remedy both pointed at a
command that reported success in green ticks and changed nothing.

It was found on a rehearsal deployment whose database had no Office or Floor role.
`test_setup_groups.py` now pins it.

⚠ **Until 2026-09-15 this section also said no migration creates these groups and
that Office and Floor are created by nothing else.** The first half is literally
true — no migration *file* creates them — and the conclusion drawn from it was
false, because `migrate` runs the hook every time. How the rehearsal database lost
them was not recorded; `copy_sqlite_to_postgres` replaces `auth.Group` wholesale,
which is one way it happens (`CLAUDE.md` § Which database am I on?).

### 3.2 If any demo data reached this database, remove it ☐

Only if something was seeded here by accident. Dry run first — it prints what
it would delete and changes nothing:

```bash
python manage.py purge_business_data
python manage.py purge_business_data --yes
```

This clears every business table — job cards (warranty cards included), both
kinds of shop with their payments and discounts, the fleet accounts, inventory
(opening stock included), the cashbook, the staff roster, **the owner
withdrawals and the rent ledger**, **the old bills**, and Change History. It
does not touch logins, groups or the master lists.

⚠ **Those last two were missing from the command until 2026-09-04**, and both
are real money: `OwnerWithdrawal` feeds Cash Tracking, and the rent rate feeds
the PROFIT equation. If this database was seeded with a version older than
that, check by hand that Deposit & Rent and Owner Withdrawals are empty before
carrying on — the purge reported success either way.

If photos were configured and any test photograph was taken against this
database, the purge deletes the rows and queues the stored objects; sweep them
out of the bucket afterwards:

```bash
python manage.py sweep_photo_blobs
python manage.py sweep_photo_blobs --yes
```

### 3.2b Read the Cashbook's keyword list once, after the real shops exist ☐

Nothing to run. The Cashbook asks before it takes an entry that looks like a
wage, an owner's draw, anything to do with rent, or a shop payment — and **the shop names
and the owner names in that list are read from the database on every page
load**, never written into the code. So the demo names disappear with the purge
above and the real ones protect themselves the moment they are created. There
is no step here and no deploy.

The one thing worth a glance: **a shop whose whole name is a common word.** The
match is the full name with word boundaries, so "Ninoos Auto Parts" only fires
on that phrase — but a shop actually called *Lubricant* or *Water* would
question ordinary entries that mention the word. It only ever ASKS, so nothing
breaks; it just gets noisy. If one of the real shops is named like that, say
so rather than living with it.

To see the list as it stands:

```bash
python manage.py shell -c "from workshop.cashbook_views import _steers; [print(r['words']) for r in _steers()]"
```

### 3.3 Owner accounts and real email addresses ☐

**A fresh database has no accounts at all.** Every earlier deployment got its
logins by copying a database, so this step never existed before. Create both
owners in the Railway console, one at a time:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- **Username** — exactly the `OWNER_1_USERNAME` / `OWNER_2_USERNAME` set in §1.3.
- **Email** — the owner's **real** address. It is how an owner signs in and where
  reset codes go, so never a test or placeholder address here.
- **Password** — a temporary one you hand over in person. The owner replaces it at
  `/change-password/` the first time they sign in.

Then, **in the same sitting**:

```bash
python manage.py sync_owner_identity          # dry run
python manage.py sync_owner_identity --yes
```

⚠ **Not optional.** `createsuperuser` sets `is_staff=True`, which opens `/admin/`
— the one door that bypasses Deletion History, the Financial Lock and
archive-don't-delete. `sync_owner_identity` closes it, puts both owners in the
Owner group and stores their mobile numbers. It reads `OWNER_n_*` from Railway's
variables, and with them unset it changes nothing.

**Office and Floor logins are created afterwards by an owner**, signed in, from
Control Hub → Accounts — never from the console.

**If an owner's email turns out to be wrong**, correct it with `set_owner_email`
rather than recreating the account. Owner accounts sign in by email only, never by
username or mobile (`resolve_login_identifier`), so this changes the owner's login
identifier and the old one stops working the moment it runs: tell the owner the
exact address they now type. An owner who types their username gets "Invalid
credentials", which reads as a wrong password and cannot be worded any more
helpfully without confirming the account exists.

```bash
python manage.py set_owner_email <username> <real@address>        # dry run
python manage.py set_owner_email <username> <real@address> --yes
```

- ☐ Both owners' emails are their real ones
- ☐ `sync_owner_identity` reports both in the Owner group, `is_staff=False`
- ☐ An owner has created the Office and Floor logins from Control Hub

**Then the two things worth more than every control in the codebase.**

The lockout allows roughly 480 guesses a day against a known account (5 tries,
15-minute lock, repeat). Against a long random password that is meaningless
forever. Against `formulad2026` it is a few days. `MinimumLengthValidator`
defaults to 8 characters and `CommonPasswordValidator` only blocks Django's
stock list — neither would refuse that password. **No amount of lockout tuning
substitutes for this, and a strong password makes the lockout question moot.**

And because reset codes go to `User.email`, an owner's inbox can already set
their password. Whoever holds that mailbox holds the workshop's books.

- ☐ Each owner's password is long and random, or a four-word passphrase — not
  the workshop name, a year, or a phone number
- ☐ Each owner's password is stored in their phone's password manager, not on
  paper and not in a chat
- ☐ **2-Step Verification is on for both owners' email accounts.** If Gmail, the
  same App Password screen used for `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` in development is
  behind it.

### 3.4 Prove password reset works ☐

Before the owners depend on it:

- ☐ Request a reset for one owner account
- ☐ The email actually arrives (check spam too, on first send from a new domain)
- ☐ The code is visible in the **subject line** / notification banner
- ☐ Completing the reset signs that account out everywhere

If the mail does not arrive, check the Railway logs for `Resend rejected a
message` — the reason is logged there.

### 3.5 Opening balances ☐

Enter the workshop's real starting position. This is the one step nobody else
can do for you and it is worth doing unhurried.

- ☐ Staff roster and current salaries
- ☐ Any unpaid customer or fleet balances
- ☐ **The monthly rent, dated to the go-live month** (Deposit & Rent → ⋮ →
  Update Rent)

**Stock and shop balances — in this order** (Manage → **Legacy Data**, Owner only):

1. ☐ Create every spare shop and Supplies Shop, and every product
   (Supplies Shops → a shop → Add Product), on the existing screens.
2. ☐ **Opening Stock** — count the shelf. For every product: how many are on the
   shelf and the **cost of one** (the last price paid). The cost is required: a
   blank cost would charge every part fitted before the next bill as ₹0 on the
   Profit page, for good. Check the total worth at the bottom against the count.
3. ☐ **Unassigned Spares** — add the one or two bought-in parts still waiting for
   a car (Spare Shops → Unassigned Spares), each against the shop it came from.
4. ☐ **Opening Balances** — for every shop, type what that shop's own book says
   is owed, **minus the price of any unassigned spares from that shop** entered in
   step 3 (book says ₹2,50,000, a ₹5,000 bearing is already in → type 2,45,000).
   The screen saves exactly what is typed; "owed now" under each name should then
   match the shop's book.
5. ☐ Start work.
6. ☐ **Lock it, at the end of go-live day**, once every figure matches the count
   and the shops' books: Manage → **Legacy Data** → **Lock Legacy Data**, then
   three red confirmations. The last one states the figures being frozen — read
   them. Afterwards both screens show their figures with no boxes and refuse any
   change, owners included, and the page says when it was locked and by whom.
   Old Bills stays open.
   ⚠ **The lock is stored in the DATABASE, so it travels**: a backup restored
   anywhere, or the whole system moved to another host, is still locked.
   *To correct a figure found wrong later:* `python manage.py unlock_legacy_data
   --yes` on the server, correct it on the screen, then press Lock again.
   *(`LEGACY_DATA_LOCKED=true` on Railway is a spare that locks without anybody
   pressing anything. It cannot unlock, and it does not travel with the data.)*

⚠ **Two things NOT to do on go-live day:**
- **Never enter an old (pre-go-live) Supplies Shop bill.** The opening balance
  already covers the debt and the shelf count already covers the goods — the bill
  would count both twice.
- **Never count a delivery on the shelf and then also enter its bill.** Count the
  shelf first; only deliveries that arrive after the count get a bill.

Payments to a shop pay its opening balance off first, and the shop page says how
much of it is left until it reaches zero. None of this moves a profit or cash
figure.

⚠ **The rent one is not optional and it is easy to skip**, because unlike the
others nothing on any screen looks broken without it. Rent is a real expense
line on the Profit page, read from that rate — so with no rate recorded the
page charges **₹0 of rent** and every month's profit reads ₹35,000 too high,
silently, from day one. Set it before the first month closes.

There is deliberately **no opening balance for the deposits**: the rent ledger
begins at the first rate's month, so set the rate from the go-live month and key
that month's handovers off the collector's book — a handful of rows, and the
position is then exact. Whatever was settled with the landlord before that month
is history between the workshop and the landlord, the same answer opening stock
gets. A window reaching back further says so on the Rent line rather than
pretending the premises were free.

### 3.5b The last Excel bill number — BEFORE the first live job card ☐

⚠ **Do this before anybody creates a job card, and do not skip it.** The Excel
bills were numbered JB-26-001, JB-26-002 … — the same shape the system uses. If
this is not set, the first live job card of 2026 is **JB-26-001**, a number a
customer from January already holds on paper.

1. ☐ Open the Excel sheet and find the **last bill written there** (e.g. JB-26-245).
   Excel billing stops today.
2. ☐ Railway → Variables → set `LAST_EXCEL_BILL_NUMBER=JB-26-245` (that exact
   shape). Railway redeploys on its own.
3. ☐ Open **Old Bills** in the app. It must read *"The last Excel bill is
   JB-26-245 — the system's own numbers start after it."* ⚠ **If that line is
   missing, the variable is not in** — nothing else on the page warns about it
   (the amber banner that used to was removed on 2026-09-17). This step is the
   only check.
4. ☐ Create the first live job card and confirm its number is **JB-26-246**.

⚠ A value that is set but not in the `JB-YY-NNN` shape **stops the app from
starting** — on purpose. If the deploy fails straight after setting it, check
the spelling first.

**Typing in the old bills comes after this, on the live system** — never on a
laptop copy, and never before the purge in §3.2 (it clears them). Split the
Excel years by month between the people typing; the Old Bills page shows each
month's count and, once few are left, the exact JB numbers not typed yet.

### 3.6 Owner devices ☐

Do this **last**, and only once the URL is final. A PWA install and its push
subscription are bound to the exact origin — change the URL later and every
device repeats this.

For each owner, on their own phone:

- ☐ Open `https://app.formuladservice.in` in Safari
- ☐ Share → **Add to Home Screen** (iOS gives push to installed apps only)
- ☐ Open the *installed* app, sign in
- ☐ Notifications page → enable push
- ☐ Trigger something (a login from another device) and confirm the phone buzzes

### 3.7 Smoke test the real thing ☐

- ☐ Create a job card, add a spare and a labour line, check the total
- ☐ Print an invoice — confirm it fits one A4 sheet
- ☐ **Save that invoice as a PDF on an owner's iPhone**, on the live HTTPS site:
      press Print, then in Save to Files **paste** into the name box — it must be
      the car, plate and bill number. This is the one part of the print-name copy
      never checked on a real iPhone. On a Windows laptop, choose **Save as PDF**,
      not *Microsoft Print to PDF* — that one always opens with a blank name
- ☐ Open a **warranty claim** for one part of a finished bill and mark the
      warranty card completed with its Shop Price still blank: the Live Report's
      *Warranty not filled* box must list it. Type a Shop Price, and the Profit
      page must show "Includes warranty claims" under Total Expenses
- ☐ Take a payment, confirm it appears in Paid Bills
- ☐ Once that card is completed, start a new card with the same plate: the make, model
      and colour must fill in by themselves, and the customer only be offered — greyed
      in, with a **Use last visit** button
- ☐ As an owner, open a bill whose card carries a real mobile number: the WhatsApp icon
      beside Print must open that customer's chat, with nothing typed in it
- ☐ Add a Cashbook entry, confirm the Profit page moves
- ☐ Record a rent deposit; confirm today's figure on `/rent/` drops by it
- ☐ Type one real **Old Bill** off the Excel sheet: the date spelled out under the
      three boxes must be right, the TOTAL must match the XL bill, and the car's profile
      must show it in the yellow Old bills section. Then confirm the Profit page did
      **not** move
- ☐ Write an Estimate, print it, confirm it carries the same letterhead as the bill
- ☐ Open a car profile → **Service History** → print; confirm the letterhead, the
      type and the foot match the bill you printed above. Then **All Invoices** on
      the same car — it must be the *same* sheet, one bill per page
- ☐ Sign in as Office and as Floor; confirm each sees only what it should
- ☐ Open the app on the Floor tablet at its real screen size
- ☐ **On a phone**, press something that asks a question — a delete, or Mark
      Completed. The card must be **centred**, not pinned to one side, and it must
      be the app's own card, never a browser dialog saying "…says"
- ☐ **On the slowest connection you can find**, press a Confirm twice. The second
      press must do nothing — one press is one post
- ☐ From a page reached by a notification or a bookmark, press the **back control**;
      it must name where it is going and actually go there
- ☐ *(if photos are configured)* Take one from the tablet's camera, reload, confirm
      it is still there — then settle the bill and confirm the camera is gone but
      the photo is still viewable

## Part 4 — Immediately after

- ☐ **Take a backup and restore-test it**, now that real data exists (§1.1)
- ☐ Turn on Railway's own Postgres backups; note the retention period
- ☐ Store one backup somewhere that is not Railway (offsite copy)
- ☐ Record the go-live date in `TITAN_MASTER_HANDOVER.md`
- ☐ Watch the Railway logs for the first few days

## Part 5 — When something goes wrong

### 5.1 Rolling back a deploy

Railway keeps previous deployments. Dashboard → Deployments → redeploy the last
good one.

**A rollback does not undo a migration.** If the bad deploy migrated the
database, roll the code back *and* restore the database from backup, or the old
code meets a schema it does not understand.

### 5.2 Restoring the database

Write the command that actually worked in §1.1 here, before you need it:

```
(fill this in during the rehearsal)
```

### 5.3 Both owners locked out

Owners cannot reset each other by design, and `manage_reset_password` refuses
Owner accounts. If email delivery is also broken, the route back is the Railway
shell:

```bash
python manage.py shell -c "
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
u = User.objects.get(username='<owner>')
u.set_password('<a temporary password>')
u.save()
print('reset', u.username)"
```

Have the owner change it immediately afterwards at `/change-password/`.

**Keeping this route available is the reason the system does not need a second
authentication factor.** The gap a TOTP app would supposedly fill is a fallback
when the recovery channel fails — and this is that fallback, with nothing to
carry, nothing to lose and nothing to expire.

### 5.4 Static files broken again

Symptom: unstyled pages, console shows `Refused to apply style ... MIME type
('text/html')`.

Cause is nearly always that `collectstatic` did not run. Check the build log.
Confirm the storage backend is the WhiteNoise one — if this ever prints
`StaticFilesStorage`, the `STORAGES` setting has been reverted:

```bash
python manage.py shell -c "from django.contrib.staticfiles.storage import staticfiles_storage; print(staticfiles_storage.__class__)"
```

### 5.5 Mail stops sending

Check Railway logs for `Resend rejected a message: HTTP <code>` — the provider's
own reason is logged. Common causes: the domain's DNS records were changed, the
API key was rotated, or the free tier's monthly limit was reached (3,000/month;
this app sends single digits per year, so this one would be a surprise).

## Appendix — Things deliberately not done

Recorded so they are not raised as oversights. See
`TITAN_MASTER_HANDOVER.md` §VII for the product-scope list, and `CLAUDE.md` §
Deliberate decisions for the engineering ones.

- **No CI/CD pipeline.** Deploys are a git push. One developer, one app.
- **No staging environment.** The demo-data deployment served that purpose.
- **No error-tracking service.** Railway's logs are the log.
- **No TOTP / second factor.** See §5.3.
- **No uptime monitoring.** Four users who will phone you.

Each of these is a reasonable thing to add later. None is a reason to delay
shipping.

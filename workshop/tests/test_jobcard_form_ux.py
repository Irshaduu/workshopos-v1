"""
The Job Card form's own shape (reworked 2026-08-13, on the owner's list).

Everything here is about the screen Office and Floor spend their day on, not
about money — but two of these guard rules that *become* money if they slip:
the internal note must never reach a customer, and the Spare Parts row must keep
posting every field it posts today whichever order the columns are in (a field
that stops being rendered saves as blank, which is how a purchase disappears off
a shop's ledger).

The visual half — the hairline on an empty box, the unsaved-changes pill, the
car-colour wash — is JavaScript and CSS, which nothing in this suite executes.
So these tests assert the things the SERVER decides: what is rendered, in what
order, and with what hooks for the script to find. Where a rule lives only in
script, the test pins the contract the script relies on rather than pretending to
run it.

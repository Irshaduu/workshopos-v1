# WorkshopOS

A workshop management system for a single premium automotive workshop. Job cards,
inventory, spare and supplier shops, fleet billing, estimates, invoicing, a cashbook,
payroll, evidence photos and owner analytics, in one Django application.

> **Final version, frozen 2026-10-09.** It never went live. The workshop's system is
> being rebuilt in a separate repository, and this one stays as its reference
> specification — every rule, edge case and reason, with the tests that hold them.

> **[SYSTEM_MAP_DARK.pdf](SYSTEM_MAP_DARK.pdf)** — the whole system on one page: every
> section as a card, every flow as a line.
>
> **[TITAN_SPEC_SHEET.md](TITAN_SPEC_SHEET.md)** — every file, model, route and rule,
> counted from the repository rather than estimated.

## Features

### Job cards

- Customer, vehicle, concerns, work performed and parts on one card.
- Parts arrive by one of two routes — bought from a spare shop for the job, or drawn
  off the warehouse shelf — and stay distinguishable all the way to the bill.
- Live progress on the dashboard and on a workshop board showing who is holding which
  car and which parts are still coming.
- Autocomplete for brands, models, spares and concerns, learning new entries as they
  are typed and matching case-insensitively.
- One active job card per registration number at a time.
- An optional chassis code and VIN on every card and estimate. Type a number plate the
  workshop has seen before and the make, model, colour and both codes fill in by
  themselves; the last customer is only offered, never filled, because cars change hands.
- A settled card locks; changing one takes an explicit unlock, and the bill is
  reconciled afterwards.

### Billing and money

- Sequential bill numbers (`JB-26-001`), safe under concurrent writes.
- **Spare shops** — per-shop ledgers, running balances, and lump-sum payments spread
  across outstanding items oldest first. When a shop — spare or Supplies — lets the
  workshop off a little, it is recorded as a discount: a payment with no cash, which
  settles the balance and counts as profit on the day, without changing what any
  part cost.
- **Fleet accounts** — repeat and fleet customers billed across many cars, with
  surplus carried forward as advance credit and reversals guarded to newest-first.
- **Unassigned spares** — record a purchase before there is a job card to attach it
  to. Mechanics can log the part; the office prices it when the shop's bill arrives.
- **Cashbook** — one searchable chronological ledger of money out and in, each entry
  dated by the day the money moved rather than the day it was typed.
- **Salary and advances** — advances recorded the day the cash is handed over, and a
  month-end settlement that freezes each person's salary, leave, advance and net pay.
  A settled month never re-prices itself, and only the most recent one can be
  corrected.
- **Deposit and rent** — the premises are paid for in daily cash instalments to a
  collector, so the page says what to hand over today: whatever is left of the
  month's rent over the days left. Pay more today and tomorrow asks for less; skip a
  day and it asks for a little more. The rent and the deposits stay two separate
  numbers — what a month cost, and how it got paid — and twenty years of history
  folds away behind one line per year.
- **Owner withdrawals** — cash the owners take out for themselves, recorded where it
  belongs. It is not a business expense and the profit figure never moves because of
  it: profit is what is available to take. It shows as cash out, and nowhere else.
- **Owner analytics** — a profit page reading `turnover − expenses` over any date
  range, the same profit again broken down by what earned it, cash movement kept
  visibly separate from profit, plus a deeper breakdown by mechanic, spare, vehicle,
  fleet account and shop.
- Audit views for large discounts and for every permanent deletion, and a 24-hour
  window on money edits and deletes — a recent mistake is the office's to correct,
  anything older is an owner's to change.

### Inventory

- Stock moves on its own: restock bills add, job-card draws remove. Nothing is edited
  by hand.
- Weighted-average costing, replayed in date order, so a backdated or corrected
  supplier bill re-prices the draws it should and leaves the rest alone.
- Stock may go negative, and is reported apart from low stock — a negative balance
  means a supplier bill has not been entered yet, not that anything needs reordering.
- **Supplier shops** — restock bills entered at the shop's own line prices, payments,
  and a catalog per supplier.

### Customer documents

- Print-ready A4 invoices on the workshop's own letterhead, rendered the same on
  screen as on paper.
- Estimates on the same letterhead, with a searchable history (`EST-26-001`).
- **Warranty**: a part that failed after the car left is claimed on its own card
  (`WR-26-001`) — one claim per part, free to the customer and never settled, the
  shop's answer kept in the part's Shop Price, and a printed slip with no prices.
- **Old Bills**: the bills written in Excel before the system, typed in so a car's
  profile, its invoices and its service history reach back to its first visit — and
  counted in no figure anywhere.
- **Legacy Data** for go-live in a running workshop: the shelf counted once
  (quantity and cost per product) and what each shop was already owed, typed once —
  then the daily workflow carries on from that position, with no profit or cash
  figure moved.
- A **service history** for one car: every visit, the distance and the days between
  them, how regularly the car has been serviced, and each part numbered across its own
  replacements with how far that fitting has run. The office can type the reading the
  customer gives on the phone, and every part currently fitted then reports against it
  — used for the calculation, never stored. It is set from the invoice: the same type
  sizes, the same weights, the same four colours, so the two documents read as one
  workshop's.
- **Every bill for one car as a single PDF**, one per page. It renders through the same
  template and the same arithmetic as the single invoice, so a customer holding both
  cannot find them differing.
- A WhatsApp button on the bill, for the owners, that opens the customer's chat. The
  owner attaches the saved PDF and presses Send; the application sends nothing itself.
- Warehouse parts are billed under their category rather than the branded product, so
  a customer's bill does not name the workshop's suppliers.

### Photos

- Car photos on a saved job card, and a set per spare part.
- Uploaded from the browser straight to S3-compatible storage on a presigned URL;
  the bytes never pass through the application.
- Entirely optional. With no storage configured the section is absent in production
  and nothing else changes; a development server falls back to local disk so the
  feature can still be worked on.

### Access and history

- Three roles — **Owner**, **Office**, **Floor** — enforced on every view, with the
  navigation and per-page controls filtered to match. Floor is shown no prices, and
  who the customer is stays with Office and the owners.
- Per-account and per-network sign-in lockout, live session monitoring with remote
  revoke, and an owner alert feed that can also push to a phone.
- Accounts other records depend on are archived rather than destroyed. Transactions
  are deleted permanently, each snapshotted first into a read-only audit log.

### Interface

- One navigation bar, at the top on a laptop and at the bottom on a phone, with a
  drawer holding everything else. Built for three devices: office laptop, workshop
  tablet, owners' phones.
- Every page carries its own way out, naming where it goes rather than relying on a
  browser Back button the installed app does not have.
- Every question is asked in the application's own card — never a browser dialog — and
  a form already on its way refuses the second press, so a slow connection cannot turn
  one tap into two payments.
- Installable as a PWA, with an offline page for unreliable workshop wifi.

## Tech stack

| Layer | |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | Python 3.13 · Django 5.2 |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL |
| **Frontend** | Server-rendered Django templates, Bootstrap 5, vanilla JavaScript — no build step and no npm |
| **Static files** | WhiteNoise with a content-hashed manifest; every frontend asset is self-hosted |
| **Outbound** | Password-reset codes by email, and Web Push for owner alerts. Both optional — the app runs correctly with neither configured |

**Dependencies:** Django, Pillow, python-decouple, psycopg2-binary, whitenoise,
gunicorn, coverage, pywebpush.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.13+, PostgreSQL, pip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Irshaduu/WorkshopOS.git
cd WorkshopOS
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it — `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows, `source venv/bin/activate`
elsewhere — then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file. `SECRET_KEY` is the only setting with no default; the database
values fall back to a local PostgreSQL instance.

```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=True
DB_NAME=titan_db
DB_USER=titan_user
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_SSLMODE=prefer
```

Set the environment selector in your shell — it has no default, so an unset value
stops the app rather than guessing a database:

```bash
export DJANGO_ENV=development
```

Then migrate, load the reference lists, and run:

```bash
python manage.py migrate && python manage.py load_master_data && python manage.py runserver
```

## Tests

```bash
python manage.py test workshop inventory --parallel 4
```

3,185 tests covering the financial rules, access control, stock signals, the printed
documents, and the supplier, fleet, salary and warranty flows. The suite runs on SQLite,
so it never touches a live database. On four workers the most recent full run took 49.6
minutes; run serially it has taken anything from 20 minutes to 2½ hours. Parallel runs
need `pip install tblib` (test-only, not in `requirements.txt`).

JavaScript tests run separately, on Node's built-in runner:

```bash
node --test "workshop/tests/js/*.test.js"
```

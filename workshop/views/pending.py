    # A CAR STILL ON THE FLOOR IS NOT A PENDING BILL. This is the chase list —
    # cars handed over that nobody has settled — and it used to carry every
    # live card as well, because a card starts PENDING the moment it is
    # created. Those are not bills yet: no figure is final, nothing was
    # handed to a customer, and there is nothing to chase. They buried the
    # cards that ARE chaseable, so the page had to be searched to be used.

    # Nothing is stranded by this. A live card is on the dashboard board the
    # whole time it is on the floor, and it appears here the moment it is
    # marked completed.

    # not settled, which is SMALLER than the Profit page's "Customers owe us"
    # — that counts every unsettled card, fleet and still-on-the-floor
    # included. The two were already different (this page excludes fleet), and
    # the subtitle under the title says which question this one answers.

    # it would sit here as "pending" for ever with nothing to chase.

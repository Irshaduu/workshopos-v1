# The brand and model forms dedupe on `__iexact`, never on the model's plain
# `unique=True`. (The spare and concern forms went with their Master Lists
# screens on 2026-09-21, AUD-0106 — those names now arrive through the job
# card's auto-learn and `load_master_data`, and are corrected in Data Cleanup.)
# That constraint is case-sensitive, so "Toyota" and "toyota" were both
# insertable, as were "Oil Filter" and "oil filter" — and ConcernSolution had no
# uniqueness at all, so the same concern could be added any number of times. The
# result was a polluted autocomplete where the same thing appeared twice and
# staff picked whichever came first, which is precisely what the taxonomy rule in
# CLAUDE.md exists to prevent. The auto-learn path in the job-card views has
# always deduped this way; these forms are the manual entry points that did not.
#
# The check excludes the row being edited, so re-saving a form without touching
# the name is never blocked by the name it already has.

# and no ordering workflow, so eight columns of ordering fields sat empty and
# invited staff to fill boxes that meant nothing.
#
# They stay ONE model on purpose — roughly twenty places read `jobcard.spares`
# (the bill total, the invoice, the shop ledger, Stock History, the analysis
# engine, the delete guard). A second model would need every one of them taught
# to union two relations, and a single miss would short a customer's bill.

    Name · Qty · Photos · Shop · Status · Dates · Shop Price · Transport, the same boxes

    blank (right for a typed figure on a new record), and here that would turn
    "free" back into "waiting" on the next save. The money boxes are tidied by
    `_tidy_claim_money` instead, which keeps a zero as 0.

    the stored one kept. The SHOP starts as the replaced part's own and may be
    changed, rarely, when the replacement came from another shop (`moved_from`
    then names the shop the part first came from). The QUANTITY may go DOWN

    A row left empty — or emptied out — is a row that does not exist.

    **Clearing the name and saving IS the delete gesture.** There is no ✕ on a
    row, deliberately: a per-row delete control is a one-tap way to lose work on
    a tablet, and a quote is typed in a hurry. So two rules:

      * A row where nothing was typed is not saved. `description` and `name` are
        NOT NULL at the column, so a row of empty strings would otherwise put an
        unnamed line on a document a customer reads.
      * **An existing row whose name has been cleared is DELETED — even if its
        figures are still there.** That is the whole gesture. Leaving the money
        behind and refusing the save would make "clear the name" mean nothing on
        exactly the rows people want to remove, which are the priced ones.

    Marking the row DELETE resolves both at once: Django's own delete path skips
    it when new (`save_new_objects`) and removes it when stored
    (`save_existing_objects`). The line forms drop `required` so a blank row
    reaches here cleanly in the first place.

    What is still refused: a **new** row carrying figures with no name
    (`EstimatePartLineForm.clean`), and any negative figure. A new row is being
    filled in, so a missing name there is a slip, not an erasure — and silently
    dropping it would throw away a price someone just typed.

workshop/analysis_views.py
==========================
Owner → Analysis & Reports.

Two pages, and the split between them is the whole point of the design:

  /analysis/            PROFIT — the protected page.
                        Turnover − Expenses = Profit, for one date window, and
                        then THE SAME PROFIT decomposed by what earned it.
                        This is what the owners open to decide profit
                        distribution, so it stays deliberately plain: no
                        drill-downs, no cleverness, nothing that needs
                        explaining. Every rupee on it traces to one of four
                        expense streams.

  /analysis/insights/   INSIGHTS — everything else. Mechanics, spare parts,
                        inventory, vehicles, fleet accounts, shops, cashbook,
                        operations. Loads one section at a time over AJAX so
                        the heavy Top-N queries only run for the section
                        actually being looked at.

All money math lives in analysis_engine.py, not here. These views resolve the
date window, call the engine, and render — so a bug in a chart can never
become a bug in the profit figure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONE WORD, ONE MEANING — across both pages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Four different figures were all called "Profit" across these two screens, an
owner reading both in one sitting. The vocabulary is now fixed:

  Profit          the bottom line, after every expense. The Profit page's
                  word, and nothing else in Analysis may use it bare.
  Gross profit    revenue − parts cost, no overhead taken off. Car profiles
                  and the Mechanics section — the same calculation, so the
                  same words.
  Margin          parts sold − parts cost. Spare Parts, Inventory, Shops.
                  Thinner than gross profit: no labour in it either.

Owner-only throughout (@owner_required); Office and Floor never see this.

    The Profit page.

    Computed eagerly (unlike Insights): indexed aggregates whose cost is a
    function of how many months are in range, not how many rows exist, and an
    owner checking profit should get the whole picture in one load rather than
    watching cards populate one by one.

    Measured 2026-09-04 against 161 job cards: **103 queries** for This Month,
    97 for This Year, 89 for All Time, 85 for Last Month and 83 for Last Year.
    The spread is the comparison: an unfinished period builds the report three
    times — the window, the comparison period, and the window trimmed to today —
    and the last two pass `disclosures=False`, which drops six footnote-only
    queries each. All Time builds it once, because it has no previous period.

    ⚠ Re-measure rather than trusting that line; it has now gone stale TWICE.
    It read "59 / 48 / 47, measured 2026-08-25", and the true figures were
    already about 94 / 76 / 78 before rent was added to the equation — so the
    line was describing a page that no longer existed. Nine of the current
    count are the rent stream, down from fifteen: `rent_expense` reads the
    months, the total and the ledger's start off ONE `rates()` lookup rather
    than three, which is why those functions take an optional `all_rates` the
    way `rate_for` and `charged_through` always have.

# THE TWO PARTS ROUTES ARE TWO SECTIONS, not two tables in one.
#
# They were one "Spares" section carrying both, and before 2026-08-25 one
# merged TABLE. Splitting the tables fixed the worst of it and left the thing
# above them still merged: a combined headline reading "Parts revenue / Parts
# cost / Parts profit / Margin" across both routes. That blended margin is a
# number with no business behind it — it averages a per-job trading margin
# against a shelf margin that depends on `avg_cost` being right — on a section
# whose own reasoning says the two are different businesses.
#
# The deciding argument is that THE OWNER ALREADY SPLITS THEM: asked what the
# workshop earns from, the answer was "labour, inventory commission, spare
# parts commission, cashbook income" — four streams, of which these are two.
# The Profit page's earnings card now names them separately too, so the two
# pages describe the business the same way.
#
# ⚠ The Spares glyph was `bi-tools`, which is the JOB PERFORMED icon — the
# section that BUYS parts wearing the icon of the section that FITS them, the
# exact mistake CLAUDE.md records being fixed on the Spare Shops pages. The
# app-wide Spare Parts glyph is `bi-gear-wide-connected`. It survived because
# `SparePartsWearsOneGlyphTests` scans templates and this list is Python.

# THE TWO ROUTES ARE TWO SECTIONS. What is shared between them is the money
# rule, and that lives in `engine.parts_trading` — one aggregate pair read by
# both sections AND by the Profit page's earnings card, so a margin quoted on
# one screen cannot disagree with the same margin one tap away.
#
# What is NOT shared is the shape of the table, and that is the whole reason
# they are separate:
#
#   • A shop row has a shop, an ordering state and a payable behind it. A draw
#     came off a shelf already paid for by a restock bill. Only the first is
#     chaseable.
#   • The COST columns are not the same kind of number. A shop line's cost is
#     the LINE TOTAL as typed; a draw's is a derived weighted average x
#     quantity. `SPARE_COST` gets each right, and printing them in one column
#     invites dividing one by a quantity that does not price it.
#   • QUANTITY means different things. A draw's quantity is what left the
#     shelf; a shop row's moves no money at all. Shown for stock, and left off
#     the shop table for exactly that reason.
#
# ⚠ THE MONEY COLUMN IS CALLED "MARGIN", NEVER "PROFIT". Four different things
# were called Profit across these two pages — the bottom line, a car's gross
# profit, a mechanic's, and this. This one is the thinnest of them: parts sold
# less parts cost, with no labour in it and no overhead taken off. `Profit` is
# now the Profit page's word alone, `Gross profit` means revenue less parts

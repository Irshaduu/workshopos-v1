/*
 * confirm.js — the app's own confirmation card, and one press per form.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO THINGS, IN ONE FILE, BECAUSE THEY ARE ONE PROBLEM. A dialog that asks
 * "are you sure?" and a guard that refuses the second tap are both answers to
 * the same question: how many times did the person mean to do this once.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACED. Twenty-one native browser dialogs — sixteen
 * `window.confirm()`, four `alert()`, one `prompt()`. They opened with
 * "127.0.0.1:8000 says", which is the browser talking rather than the app,
 * and they rendered the question, the reason and the way out as one flat grey
 * block that cannot carry a glyph, a colour or a field.
 *
 * ⚠ ONE DIALOG, NOT TWENTY-ONE. The markup is `_confirm_dialog.html`,
 * included once in base.html; the paint is `.wcf-*` in static/css/style.css.
 * That is the `.rpay-*` rule — a control drawn by more than one template gets
 * ONE declaration — and it is why converting these did not add twenty-one
 * things to keep in step. What varies per screen is the CONTENT and two theme
 * values; what must never vary is the shape.
 *
 * TWO WAYS IN, and the split is deliberate:
 *
 *   DECLARATIVE — `data-confirm` on a <form>. No page script at all, and it
 *   works on a row that arrived by AJAX after load, because the listener is
 *   delegated on `document`. This is how the plain "post this and go" sites
 *   are written: an undo, a handover, a reactivation, a delete.
 *
 *   IMPERATIVE — `wsConfirm(opts)`, returning a Promise. For the sites whose
 *   question depends on what was just typed: the rent date, the master-list
 *   merge, the settlement overwrite, a photo delete inside a fetch handler.
 *
 * ⚠ `bootstrap` IS NOT DEFINED WHILE THIS FILE IS PARSED. base.html renders
 * the content block above its script tags, so a `new bootstrap.Modal(...)` at
 * the top level would throw and take every listener below it with it — the
 * trap CLAUDE.md records. The instance is built on FIRST USE, by which time
 * the bundle has arrived.

     * The short box's one line under it. The caller's `check(value)` returns a

     * ⚠ HIDE THE PARENT MODAL FIRST, AND WAIT FOR IT TO ACTUALLY BE GONE.
     *
     * Hiding it at all is the house pattern (`confirmSubmit` on both shop pages
     * does the same) and it exists because a shown Bootstrap modal or offcanvas
     * runs a document-wide focus trap: an input in anything opened over it
     * cannot hold the caret, which is the defect that sent every Fleet reversal
     * to the Owner's Deletion History with a blank reason.
     *
     * ⚠ THE WAITING IS THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO GET WRONG, and it shipped wrong
     * for an hour. Calling `hide()` and then `show()` in the same tick does not
     * close the parent: Bootstrap refuses a `hide()` while `_isTransitioning`,
     * and even when it takes, the two overlap — MEASURED on the Data Cleanup
     * rename, which drew TWO stacked backdrops, left the parent open behind the
     * card, and then left ONE BACKDROP BEHIND after Cancel, because the parent's
     * own hide finished after the card had already claimed `modal-open`. A page
     * dimmed by a backdrop nothing can dismiss is unusable, and nothing in the
     * Django suite executes a line of this.
     *
     * So it resolves on `hidden.bs.modal` — the parent is fully gone before the
     * card is shown, one backdrop exists at any moment, and only one focus trap
     * is ever active. The timer is a safety net, not the mechanism: a parent
     * whose event never arrives must not swallow the question.

             * trusting an event. Bootstrap REFUSES a `hide()` while the modal
             * is still opening — it returns at its own `_isTransitioning` guard
             * and raises nothing at all. MEASURED on Data Cleanup, which
             * renders 222 modals: its open transition had not finished 900ms
             * after the trigger, so a single `hide()` was swallowed, the parent
             * stayed on screen behind the card, and the page was left with a
             * backdrop nothing could dismiss.
             *
             * Two smarter versions were tried first and both were worse. Waiting
             * on `hidden.bs.modal` alone hangs on the swallowed call. Stripping
             * `fade` to force an instant close cut the very transition the retry
             * was waiting on, because Bootstrap finishes a transition from the
             * classes present when it STARTED — so the parent never closed at
             * all. Re-asking on a timer needs no private state and no theory
             * about which event will arrive: it simply keeps asking until the
             * modal is gone.
             *
             * The ceiling exists so a parent that will not close can never
             * swallow the question — after it, the card opens anyway.

     * The handoff above is what stops that happening, and it is clean in normal

     * the page agree with what is actually on screen. Nothing shown means no
     * backdrop and no lock; something still shown means the lock belongs there.
     *
     * It exists because ONE case survives the handoff — a form submitted inside
     * the ~150ms while its own modal is still animating open, where Bootstrap
     * interrupts its own transition and re-asserts `show` after the hide. That
     * needs a submit faster than anybody can type, so it is not worth more

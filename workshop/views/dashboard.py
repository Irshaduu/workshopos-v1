#: `?mechanic=` value for the WARRANTY chip (2026-10-08): the board narrowed to

    ONE aggregate over the floor, and it is also the ONLY list of valid
    `?mechanic=` values, so a chip and the filter it applies cannot disagree.

    Three rules, each of which this app already follows somewhere else:

      * **A mechanic holding no car gets no chip.** `_floor_by_mechanic`'s own
        rule one screen over — every name on the board has work under it, which
        is what keeps the row short enough to read at a glance. It also makes
        the row self-consistent: a chip that could only ever open an empty board
        is a door with nothing behind it.
      * **The counts sum to All by construction**, the unassigned group
        included, so the row can never quietly lose a car. That is the "every
        job card is accounted for" rule the How Customers Paid table follows.
      * **Ordered by NAME, never by count.** Ordered by how many cars each
        holds, a chip moves out from under the thumb reaching for it every time
        a car changes hands. Alphabetical is stable, and it is the order the
        Live Report already lists the same names in.

    `.order_by()` is not tidying. The board's queryset is ordered by
    `-updated_at`, and an ordering field on a `values().annotate()` joins the
    GROUP BY — which would return one row per (mechanic, timestamp) and count
    every car as 1. Cleared explicitly, so a later edit to the board's ordering
    cannot silently break the counts.

    The Live Report — the workshop's state, for the two roles that act on it.

    Office and Owner only. It was `@staff_required` with the board gated inside
    it, because "Live Jobs" underneath was for everybody; that list has gone —
    the home page's own car cards, and the live details inside them, do that job
    better and are where Floor already works. What is left is entirely supplier
    names, ordering state and money-side gaps, none of which Floor is shown
    anywhere else in the app. The nav pill has always been gated `is_owner or
    is_office`, so the template gate and the decorator now agree.

    Three questions, in the order an owner asks them:

      1. what has already been BILLED with holes in it — the critical one,
         because settling is what closed the door on correcting it;
      2. what has just landed, which parts are travelling, and which nobody
         has ordered;
      3. who is holding which car, and what is still open on each of them —
         the board the next instruction is given from.

    The floor board sits LAST, on the owner's instruction. It is the longest
    block on the page by far — one panel per mechanic, every open concern under
    every car — so above the parts boxes it pushed all three of them off the
    first screen. The two chase lists are scanned; this one is read.

    None of this is narrowed by a search box, deliberately. The page answers
    "what is the state of the workshop right now", and a half-filtered answer
    to that is worse than no answer.

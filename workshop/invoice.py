"""
What a CUSTOMER DOCUMENT prints — one module, no views, no HTTP.

Two documents leave this workshop: the INVOICE for work that was done, and the
ESTIMATE for work being quoted. `build_invoice()` and `build_estimate()` are the
whole public surface, and they live in one file on purpose. (A third, the
WARRANTY SLIP — free work because of an earlier bill — is `build_warranty_slip`,
here for the same reason: what a customer is handed is decided in one place.)

Same shape as `analysis_engine.py` and `master_data.py`: the rule lives in one
importable place so a second screen (a PDF export, a WhatsApp share, a reprint
from Paid Bills) cannot grow its own slightly-different answer to "what does the
customer see?". The estimate is the sharpest case of that — it is handed over
first and the invoice follows it, so if the two ever disagreed about how a
quantity, a blank price or a labour charge reads, the customer is the one who
finds out. They share `effective_quantity`, `derive_unit_price`, `PartLine`, `JobLine`
and the row-padding constants for exactly that reason. Do not fork them.

The printed bill is deliberately NOT a transcription of the job card. Four
things differ, and each is a decision rather than a shortcut:

1. **Both spare routes print in one PART NAME section.** `JobCardSpareItem`
   already holds a shop purchase and a warehouse draw in one table, told apart
   by `source` — the Job Card *edits* them as two sections because a draw has no
   shop and no ordering workflow, but a customer has no interest in which shelf
   a part came off. One list, insertion order, one subtotal.

2. **A warehouse draw is named by its CATEGORY, not its product.** `Item.name`
   is the branded SKU the workshop buys ("Castrol Edge 5W-30"); `Category.name`
   is what it is ("Engine Oil"). The bill says what was fitted. Naming the brand
   on a customer document also publishes the workshop's supply chain, which is
   nobody's business but theirs. Shop-bought spares keep their free-text name —
   those are typed per job and are already described the way the customer would
   describe them.

3. **Labour prints without per-line amounts, because there are none.** The
   workshop quotes work as a whole — a customer is told "₹22,300 for the job",
   never a price per line — so Office types one figure into
   `JobCard.labour_amount` and the Jobs section lists only what was done. The
   printed section mirrors that exactly: descriptions, then one SUBTOTAL.
   `JobCardLabourItem.amount` is the column this replaced and is dormant; the
   subtotal here comes from the card, never from summing the lines.

4. **A blank QTY is ONE for the money, and a single part prints NEITHER a
   quantity NOR a unit price.** Staff routinely leave the box empty for a single
   part, so blank has to resolve to 1 somewhere — before it did, the unit-price
   column divided by nothing and printed ₹0.00 beside a real amount. But the
   workshop writes a quantity down only when there is more than one of
   something, and on a row of one the unit price *is* the amount, so printing it
   is the same figure twice in adjacent columns. QTY and UNIT PRICE are the
   breakdown of the amount; with one unit there is nothing to break down, and
   the row prints as a name and a price, which is how the workshop says it.
   Blank, a typed 1 and a typed 1.00 therefore produce byte-for-byte identical
   output — two empty cells — while anything that is not one (2, or a genuine
   0.5) itemises in full. The arithmetic never changes: every figure is still
   computed from a quantity of one.

Nothing here is a money source of truth. `grand_total` is the job card's own
denormalized `total_bill_amount`, exactly as the rest of the app reads it; the
two subtotals are the same rows re-added for display, and equal it by
construction (see `JobCard.update_totals`).

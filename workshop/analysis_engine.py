===========================
The money math behind Owner → Analysis & Reports.

This module holds **no view code and no HTML** — only pure functions that take a
date window and return Decimals/dicts. That separation is deliberate: the Profit
page is what the owners use to decide profit distribution, so the arithmetic has
to be testable on its own, without going through a request.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PROFIT MODEL  (agreed with the owner, 2026-07-27)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

        TOTAL TURNOVER  −  TOTAL EXPENSES  =  PROFIT

TURNOVER
  • Car Bills .......... JobCard.total_bill_amount − discount_amount
                         Discounts are money never earned, so they are netted
                         off rather than shown as an expense. For a settled
                         card this lands exactly on received_amount (verified
                         against live data), which is why it is the honest
                         "what the workshop actually earned" figure.
  • Cashbook Income .... CashbookEntry(entry_type=INCOME) — scrap sales etc.
  • Discounts from shops  SpareShopDiscount + inventory.SupplierDiscount — money
                         a shop let us off, income on the day it was given
                         (2026-09-29). It NEVER changes what a part cost: a
                         Supplies Shop bill carries no discount of its own, so
                         a draw is still costed at the bill's line price.

EXPENSES — six real, non-overlapping money-out streams, ALL ON ONE BASIS:
what the work done in this period cost.
  1. Spare Shops ....... Parts bought from a spare shop *for a specific job*:
                         the `unit_price` LINE TOTAL on JobCardSpareItem rows
                         that have source=SHOP and a shop recorded. Not
                         multiplied by quantity — see SHOP_LINE_COST.
  2. Inventory Used .... Parts taken off the warehouse shelf onto a job card:
                         source=INVENTORY rows at their weighted-average cost.
  3. Salary ............ From the Salary & Advance section — never from the
                         Cashbook. See salary_expense() for how advances are
                         folded in without double counting.
  4. General Cashbook .. CashbookEntry(entry_type=EXPENSE) — power, water,
                         consumables, tools…  Shown broken down by category.
  5. Rent .............. What the premises cost for the whole months in the
                         window, from `RentRate` — never from the deposits.
                         See rent_expense().
  6. Parts transport ... What it cost to bring spare-shop parts in, paid to
                         anyone but the shop (2026-10-01). Dated by the job
                         like the part it came with; never part of a shop's
                         debt. Shown only when there is some. See
                         parts_transport().

  (+) Other spare purchases — a *transparency* line, normally ₹0. See
      unattributed_spare_expense().

⚠ RENT COMES FROM THE RATE, AND THE DAILY DEPOSITS ARE CASH. Until 2026-09-04
rent arrived here as a Cashbook category and the Deposit & Rent section touched
this module nowhere — a deliberate boundary, and a correct one for exactly as
long as the office kept keying the monthly bill into the Cashbook. It stopped
being correct when they started recording rent in its own section instead:
September 2026 carried ₹35,000 of real rent and this page charged ₹900 of it,
while May–August carried ₹45,000 Cashbook rows against a stored rate of
₹35,000. Two different rents in one system, and neither page aware of the
other.

So a Cashbook category NAMED like rent is now a DOUBLE COUNT, and is flagged
(`RENT_WORDS`) exactly as a wage-looking one is — never filtered, because
"Rent agreement stamp paper" is a real running cost.

⚠ A SUPPLIES SHOP BILL IS NOT AN EXPENSE. Buying stock converts cash (or a
promise to pay) into goods on a shelf; it is not a cost until the goods are
used. The bill moves the payable in `financial_position()` and raises the
shelf; an instalment paid against it moves the payable again. NEITHER TOUCHES
PROFIT. `supplier_billed()` still reports what was billed, and must never be
added back alongside stream 2 — that is one delivery charged twice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
AND THE SAME PROFIT, SAID THE OWNER'S WAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The owners do not think "turnover minus expenses". Asked what the workshop
earns from, the answer is four things:

    LABOUR + SPARE PARTS MARGIN + INVENTORY MARGIN + CASHBOOK INCOME
        (less discounts given)             =  GROSS EARNINGS
    less SALARY, RENT and CASHBOOK EXPENSE =  THE SAME PROFIT

`earnings_breakdown()` builds the second, and it closes with NOTHING in
between — no conversion, no reconciling line. That is only true because both
descriptions charge stock at the same moment. If a bridging line ever has to
come back, the two bases have drifted apart and that is the bug.

⚠ EVERY SHARED FIGURE IS HANDED IN, RENT INCLUDED. Leaving it out of `spend`
would land this card on a profit ₹35,000 a month above the equation printed
directly over it — and the whole safety of saying the profit twice is that the
second statement lands on the first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE DOUBLE-COUNT RULE — the single most important thing in this file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A part is charged EXACTLY ONCE, at the moment it is fitted to a car. Which
route it took is **stored**, in `JobCardSpareItem.source`, and never inferred:

  SHOP      — ordered from a spare shop for that job   → stream 1
  INVENTORY — taken off the warehouse shelf            → stream 2

The two routes partition the spare rows exactly, so every rupee of parts cost
lands in exactly one stream: none lost, none doubled.

⚠ THE DOUBLE COUNT TO GUARD AGAINST IS THE RESTOCK BILL. Stream 2 charges the
shelf when it is emptied; adding `supplier_billed()` on top would charge the
same goods again when they were bought. Against the seeded data that is roughly
₹6.9L of invented expense.

(Until 2026-08-25 the rule pointed the other way: the BILL was the expense and
the draw was excluded. It changed on the owner's decision, because it put the
two parts routes on two different bases — the spare route has always been dated
by `job_card__admitted_date`, with `unassigned_spare_purchases` holding back
what is not yet fitted — and because it made monthly profit lumpy: a delivery
month carried a whole bill while the months that consumed it looked rich. The
guard is the same shape, it just names a different second helping.)

Until 2026-07-30 there was no `source` column and this module GUESSED the route:
a NULL shop plus a case-insensitive match of `spare_part_name` against
`Item.name`. The stock signals guessed by a *different* rule, so the two could
disagree — a shop-bought part whose name happened to equal a stock product was
billed to the shop here *and* deducted from the shelf there, one part paid for
once but counted twice, with the shelf drifting down until a restock bill
covered it. Do not reintroduce name matching in either place.

A SHOP row with no shop recorded is real money with no payee. It gets its own
line rather than being silently dropped — that is what
unattributed_spare_expense() is for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATING RULE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every stream is dated by its own natural date, so a period never mixes bases:
    car bills + ALL their parts cost → JobCard.admitted_date
      (parts transport included)
    cashbook (income & expense)      → CashbookEntry.date
    salary                           → SalaryPayment.month (the 1st)
    rent                             → the rent month (the 1st), capped at
                                       the month in progress
Keeping a job's revenue and that job's parts cost on the same date is what
makes a month's margin internally consistent — and it is now true of BOTH
parts routes, which is what let the reconciling line go.

`SupplierRestockBill.bill_date` still dates two things, neither of which is an
expense: the shelf's average cost (`inventory/costing.py` replays receipts in
date order) and `supplier_billed()`.

⚠ RENT IS THE ONLY STREAM THAT NEEDS A CAP, because it is the only one not
summed from rows. No row exists in the future, so every other stream is
self-limiting; `this_year` resolves to 1 Jan – 31 Dec deliberately, so an
uncapped rent walk charges twelve months on 4 September — ₹1,05,000 of expense
that has not happened, on the page distribution is decided from. The cap lives
in `rent.charged_by_month`, which is the only implementation of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Built for 5+ years of history (live: 5,478 job cards over 2021→2026):
  • pure SQL aggregates — never a Python loop over a queryset
  • every filter narrows by date before aggregating
  • Coalesce() on every Sum, so NULL money never becomes None
  • the monthly series is a fixed number of grouped queries, not one per month

# WHAT A SPARE COST — one definition, and the two routes are NOT the same shape
# =============================================================================
# Changed 2026-08-17 on the owner's instruction, and it is a change of MEANING
# on one route, not of arithmetic on both.
#
#   SHOP     `unit_price` is the LINE TOTAL the shop billed for that row, as
#            Office typed it off the shop's own bill. Nothing multiplies it.
#   WAREHOUSE `unit_price` is the weighted-average cost of ONE unit, snapshotted
#            from `Item.avg_cost` by `JobCardSpareItem.save()` and rewritten by
#            `inventory/costing.py`'s replay. It is per unit by construction —
#            it is derived from the shelf, never typed — so a draw's cost is
#            still `× quantity` and must stay that way.
#
# Why the shop side moved: this workshop enters what it was billed, not a rate.
# A row reading 5,000 with a Qty of 2 was being read as ₹10,000 owed, and the
# owner confirmed staff type the whole amount — so the multiplication was
# inventing money nobody was billed. It also removes the last division from the
# path between a typed figure and a ledger: what is typed is what is owed.
#
# Both are declared here because five places used to hand-roll this expression
# (this module, `SpareShop.update_totals`, and three aggregates in
# `views/spare_shop.py`), which is five chances for one of them to be fixed and
# the rest left behind — and they would disagree exactly where it matters, as a
# shop page and the Profit page quoting different debts for the same rows.
# A missing price is ₹0 on both routes; a missing quantity is 1 unit, which now

#:
#: ⚠ IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT INSIDE `SPARE_COST`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY OF

    NOT charged, while the Supplies Shop BILL was charged on its bill date. Two

      • It made monthly profit lumpy for no reason an owner could act on. A
        month with a big delivery carried the whole bill; the months that
        consumed it looked rich. Measured against the meeting data, July read
        ₹5,36,500 where the work done that month actually earned ₹4,33,500.
      • THE OTHER PARTS ROUTE NEVER WORKED THAT WAY. `spare_shop_expense` is
        dated by `job_card__admitted_date` and only counts rows attached to a
        card — a shop part is expensed when it is FITTED, not when the shop
        billed it, and `unassigned_spare_purchases` exists precisely to hold
        the ones not yet fitted out of the figure. So the workshop had two
        parts routes on two different bases, and this was the odd one out.

    Both routes now answer one question: what did the parts fitted to cars in
    this period cost us. That is also what makes the earnings breakdown close
    with no conversion line — see `earnings_breakdown`.

    ⚠ A DRAW WITH NO COST COUNTS AS ₹0, so it reads as a free part and pushes
    profit UP. That was a footnote when this figure was only reported; it now
    moves the headline, which is why `uncosted_draw_count()` is load-bearing

    the shop for it either way. Returning it to the shop is the one other exit,
    and that deletes the row.

    NOT AN EXPENSE YET, AND THAT IS CORRECT — the cost lands when the part goes
    onto a job card, which is the same rule every other spare-shop purchase
    follows (`_live_spares` dates spare cost by `job_card__admitted_date`, so a
    part's cost sits in the same month as the revenue it helped earn).

    ⚠ THE ALTERNATIVE IS WORSE THAN IT LOOKS, so do not "fix" this by counting

    card — `unassigned_spare_edit` never writes `job_card` — so the part is

    something done weeks later is far worse than a cost arriving a month late.

    months have three states). So for the whole of any month, "This Month" —

    with the salary line reading ₹0, against a true wage bill of about
    ₹1,20,000 a month. That is a THIRD of the profit missing from the one page
    profit distribution is decided from, and the only thing on screen saying so
    was the words "0 month(s) settled" under a heading.

    Nothing is estimated. Inventing a wage figure from last month's settlement

    does not guess money — a NULL warehouse cost is reported as unknown rather

    FROM THE RATE, NEVER FROM THE DEPOSITS, and that is the whole point of the

    happened to move; the daily handovers are how it gets PAID. Charge the
    deposits instead and a month where the office had a good cash week reports
    a higher rent than a lean one, so monthly profit swings on a cash-flow
    decision rather than on what the month cost — on the page the owners read
    to decide distribution.

# =============================================================================
# Added 2026-08-25 on the owner's instruction. The owner does not think of this
# business as "turnover minus expenses"; they think of it as FOUR THINGS THAT
# EARN — labour, the margin on parts bought per job, the margin on parts taken
# off the shelf, and the occasional bit of scrap income — less the running
# costs. Both descriptions are true of the same workshop, and the page states
# both rather than making the owner translate between them.
#
#     LABOUR + SPARE PARTS MARGIN + INVENTORY MARGIN + CASHBOOK INCOME
#         (less discounts given)              =  GROSS EARNINGS
#     less SALARY and GENERAL CASHBOOK        =  THE SAME PROFIT
#
# ⚠ THAT IS THE WHOLE ARITHMETIC, and it closes with nothing in between.
#
# It did not, briefly. This card first shipped alongside an equation that
# charged a Supplies Shop BILL on its bill date while the card charged stock
# when it was USED, so a "stock movement" line had to sit at the bottom
# converting one basis into the other. It reconciled to the rupee and it was
# the wrong answer to the problem: a page that has to explain itself to itself
# is a page nobody trusts, and the owner said so plainly — "I am more confused
# now."
#
# The fix was to pick ONE basis, not to word the bridge better. Both parts
# routes now cost what was FITTED to cars in the period, which is what
# `spare_shop_expense` had always done — that route is dated by
# `job_card__admitted_date` and `unassigned_spare_purchases` exists to hold
# back the parts not yet fitted. The warehouse route was the odd one out.
#
# THE DISCOUNT IS ITS OWN LINE, and leaving it out was the easy mistake here —
# the identity does not close without it. A discount is given on the WHOLE
# bill, so it belongs to neither the labour line nor either margin. Shown only
# when there is some, exactly as the Turnover card shows it.
#
# NOT DEDUCTED TWICE: `unattributed_spare_expense` — a shop purchase with no
# shop recorded — is already inside the shop side's cost here, because
# `parts_trading` costs every SOURCE_SHOP row whether or not a shop was named.
# The equation splits it out as its own expense line; this one absorbs it.
# Deducting it here as well would understate profit by that amount.

    What parts SOLD for and what they COST, split by route.

    One implementation, read by three surfaces: the Profit page's earnings
    breakdown and the two Deep Analysis parts sections. They ask one question
    at two depths, and a second copy would be two answers free to disagree —
    which, one tap apart, reads as the app contradicting itself about a margin.

    Revenue is `total_price`, the customer price, on both routes. Cost is
    `SPARE_COST`, which is route-aware and must stay that way: a shop line's
    cost is the line total as typed, a warehouse draw's is a weighted average
    x quantity.

    ⚠ An uncosted draw (`unit_price` NULL) costs ₹0 here, so it reads as a FREE
    part and pushes the stock margin UP. `uncosted_draw_count()` is what says
    so — do not quietly exclude those rows instead, or the subtotal would stop
    adding up from the table printed above it.

    It returns BOTH sides even though each parts section reads only one, which
    costs that section one extra aggregate. That is the price of the guarantee
    and it is worth paying: because both sides come out of one call, they
    partition the spare rows exactly — no row counted twice, none dropped — and

def cash_position(start, end):
    """
    MONEY IN AND MONEY OUT — cash, by the day it actually moved.

    ⚠ THIS IS NOT PROFIT AND MUST NEVER BE MIXED INTO IT. Profit and cash
    differ by five things at once — stock bought but unused, stock used but
    bought earlier, bills unpaid, bills paid from earlier periods, and customer
    bills unpaid — so an owner who subtracts one from the other gets a number
    that is not anything. Nothing here appears in `build_profit_report`, and
    nothing from the profit equation is reported here as though it were cash.
    The card that draws this says so on its face.

    THE THREE TRAPS, each of which would break it silently:

    1. A FLEET CARD'S `received_amount` IS CUMULATIVE. Summing job cards for
       fleet money counts a card's whole life on the day it finally closed — a
       1,10,000 card collected over three months landing entirely in the third.
       Fleet cash comes from `BulkPaymentHistory`, one row per payment, dated
       by the day the money moved (the column added in `0072` for this). So the
       walk-in half is `payment_status='PAID'` ONLY: including `BULK_PAID`
       would count every fleet rupee twice.

    2. WAGES ARE DATED BY THE SALARY MONTH, not the day they were handed over,
       and that is deliberate. Settlement happens at month end or the 1st or
       2nd of the next month — it straddles the boundary — so the same wage
       bill would land in different months depending on which side of midnight
       somebody pressed a button. The salary month never moves, the owners
       already think of August's wages as August's cost, and every other figure
       in this app agrees (`salary_expense` filters `SalaryPayment.month`).
       Accepted consequence: August's wages are shown in August though the cash
       left in early September — a constant one-month shift that repeats
       identically every month, so it never accumulates.

    3. IT REUSES `salary_expense`, it does not restate it. That function
       already carries the guard that an advance inside a settled month is not
       counted twice — once inside its settlement and again as a loose advance.
       A second implementation here would be a second answer, free to drift.

    Everything else is dated by its own `date` column: both shop ledgers, the
    Cashbook, and now fleet payments. Every one of those is the day the money
    moved, so the streams are on one basis and can honestly be added.

    # card up. That is deliberately a DIFFERENT question from the Deposit &
    # Rent hero's carry figure, which stops at the end of last month because it
    # asks whether the FINISHED months are square; charge September there and
    # the page reads "behind ₹35,000" from the 1st to the 5th every month.

    # ⚠ IT WAS FULL WIDTH FOR A DAY, AND SO WAS THE STOCK TILE. The card was
    # a two-column grid filled row by row, so five half-width tiles always
    # orphaned one in a half-empty row, and a tile carrying a `note` line is
    # taller than its neighbours — hence a row each. The owner's call
    # (2026-09-04) was that the two read as odd slabs under four normal boxes:
    # **every tile is the same shape now**, and the card splits by DIRECTION
    # instead. See `tile_columns` below.

        # stock". Splitting the card by direction puts the two figures in
        # opposite columns instead of one above the other, so the comparison is
        # made ACROSS the card. Both are still on one screen without scrolling,
        # which was the original point; the lever, if the owner wants them
        # level again, is the order of the owed column.

    of rules, no chance of two implementations drifting. `job_card` set means a
    car photo; `spare` set means a part photo.

    **Exactly one of them is ever populated, and the DATABASE enforces it.**
    `clean()` alone would not: Django does not call it on `save()`, so a model
    check is advisory and only forms honour it — and this model has no form, it
    is written by an endpoint. The `CheckConstraint` is what makes the rule
    true. A row with both set would count against two different limits and show
    in two galleries; a row with neither is reachable from no screen at all and
    invisible to the sweep.

    `spare` alone is enough for a part photo because an unassigned spare has no
    job card at all, and those rows are photographed like any other.

    WHY THIS SECTION IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL
    ---------------------------------------
    Nothing points AT a photo. There is no column on `JobCard` or
    `JobCardSpareItem`, no money, no stock, no ledger line, nothing in
    `analysis_engine.py` and nothing in `invoice.py` — so a photo can never
    reach a customer's bill, exactly as the internal note cannot. Photos also
    upload independently of the form POST, so R2 being slow, down, or entirely
    unconfigured cannot block a job card from saving. And `settlement.py` must
    never chase a missing photo: turning "no photos" into a settlement gap would
    paint every ordinary card red on the Live Report, which is the opposite of
    optional.

    The primary key is a UUID because it doubles as the storage key (see
    `photos.object_key`) — derived, never stored, so the database and the bucket
    cannot disagree about where an image lives. It also means a key cannot be
    guessed from a sequence.

    `taken_at` is set by the SERVER. The gallery prints it, and a tablet whose
    clock is wrong would otherwise put a confident, false time on evidence.

# WHAT A FLEET STILL OWES - ONE DEFINITION, READ BY EVERY SCREEN.
#
# There were two, and they agreed in ordinary use, which is why nothing caught
# them. `get_pending_balance` was the stored columns
# (`total_billed_amount - total_paid_amount`): EVERY card ever raised, GROSS of
# discount, against the payment LEDGER. The fleet panel and the account page
# asked a different question - what is unpaid on the cards still OPEN. They
# part company on two states the workshop really reaches:
#
#   - a settled card carrying a DISCOUNT leaves that discount sitting in the
#     stored balance for ever, so an account that owes nothing reads as still
#     owing it. Worst on the ARCHIVED list, which by construction holds only
#     accounts with no open cards at all;
#   - an overpayment banked as `advance_balance` is money in the payment ledger
#     that is on no card, so the stored balance swings into credit while the
#     open cards correctly say nothing is owed.
#
# The stored columns STAY. They are honest facts - what was billed, what was
# paid - and the audit reads them directly. What changed is that the BALANCE is
# no longer one of them: every screen now asks the job cards, through these.
#
# `total_bill_amount` is `spares + labour_amount`, written by
# `JobCard.update_totals()`, so re-deriving a card's bill from its parts here
# would be the same figure by a second route - the thing this rule exists to
# stop. Verified against the development data: 0 of 14 fleet cards disagree.
#
# It also closes a trap the fleet panel used to carry a hand-written warning
# about. Rebuilding the bill meant summing the labour separately, and the
# obvious column to sum is `JobCardLabourItem.amount` - DORMANT since
# 2026-08-04, never written, so every card raised since would have reported
# ZERO labour and understated what the fleet owes. Reading the card's own total
# cannot make that mistake, because there is no labour column here to pick.

    Profit is what is *available* to take; taking it cannot reduce it. Put this
    anywhere inside `build_profit_report` and the error compounds in the worst
    direction there is — profit falls, so the page reports less left to
    distribute, over money that has already been distributed, and the next
    distribution is decided from the smaller figure.

    It IS real cash leaving the drawer, so it belongs in exactly one place:
    `cash_position()`'s money-out list, dated by `date`, the day it was taken.
    That is the same basis every other line on that card already uses.

    WHY THE TABLE EXISTS AT ALL, rather than "just use the Cashbook": the
    Cashbook is an expense ledger, and `cashbook_expense()` feeds the profit
    equation as General Cashbook. An owner recording "₹50,000 — Owner" there
    quietly cuts reported profit by ₹50,000. Before this table there was
    nowhere correct for that money to go, which made the one place that breaks
    the figure also the likeliest place for it to land.

# DEPOSIT & RENT — what the premises cost, and the daily cash that pays for it

# Two tables and nothing else. Every other figure in the section — today's
# suggested deposit, the carry from last month, the running position — is
# derived on read in `workshop/rent.py`, which is where the reasoning lives.
#
# ⚠ THE RENT AND THE DEPOSITS ARE TWO DIFFERENT NUMBERS. The rent is what is
# OWED for a month; the deposits are how it gets PAID, in daily cash to a
# collector who keeps his own book. They agree only by accident, in any given
# month, and the whole section exists to show the gap between them.


class RentRate(models.Model):
    """
    What the premises cost per month, from a stated month onward.

    EFFECTIVE-DATED, NEVER EDITED IN PLACE. A rent change is a new row carrying
    the month it starts, so a hike never rewrites what an earlier month cost
    and the history reads as a list of what the rent has been:

        Jan 2026    ₹40,000
        Apr 2025    ₹35,000

    ⚠ THE FIGURE IS ABSOLUTE, NOT AN INCREMENT, and that was a real decision.
    A "+₹5,000" adjustment is a delta on a number the person has to already
    know, so a mis-keyed `+5000` where `5000` was meant is silently ₹40,000 —
    and after a few of them nobody can say what the rent IS without adding them
    up. The landlord says "forty thousand from January". Store that.
    ⚠ A RATE MAY BE BACKDATED, and that is legitimate rather than a hole. Rent
    hikes are routinely agreed late and applied from an earlier month, and
    refusing one would leave the books permanently wrong. It reprices those
    months, which is correct — but it is Owner-only and logged precisely
    because past months move, which is the one thing that must never happen
    SILENTLY.
    ⚠ IT MAY ALSO BE DATED AHEAD — a hike announced now, effective next month.
    That is the one forward date in this section, and it is safe because
    `rate_for()` only applies a rate once its month has arrived. Nothing that
    MOVES money may be dated forward; a rate moves none by itself.
    `effective_from` is pinned to the 1st in `save()`, so a rate and a month
    are always directly comparable, and it is unique — one rent per month, and
    re-stating a month replaces it rather than adding a second answer.

# ESTIMATES — a quote, and nothing more
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An estimate is a piece of paper handed to a customer BEFORE any work is agreed.
# It is deliberately connected to nothing: no job card, no spare shop, no
# warehouse stock, no ledger, no line on the Profit page. Money on an estimate is
# a proposal, and a proposal that moved stock or entered a report would be the
# workshop counting work it has not done.
#
# That isolation is the design, not an unfinished edge. Three consequences worth
# knowing before "connecting it up":
#
#   * These three models are read by exactly two views and one printing
#     function. Nothing in `analysis_engine.py`, `inventory/signals.py` or any
#     ledger touches them, and nothing should start to.
#   * The lines are free text — even the part name — for the same reason a job
#     card's is (see the taxonomy decision in CLAUDE.md). An estimate is typed
#     fastest of all, often with the customer waiting.
#   * Deleting one moves no money, so it does NOT write a DeletionLog row. See
#     `estimate_delete` for why that is the deliberate answer and not an
#     oversight.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
class EditLog(models.Model):
    """
    Immutable, Owner-only record of every edit that moved money on a saved row.

    DeletionLog's twin, and it exists for the same reason. An edit can do
    everything a delete can — retype ₹50,000 as ₹500 — and until this table the
    only trace of one was its bell note or phone alert, which is a FEED: read
    rows are swept after `Notification.RETENTION_DAYS`, and `notify()`
    excludes the actor. So two weeks on, nothing anywhere said what a figure
    used to be. This does, for good.

    ⚠ `record()` IS THE ONLY WAY AN EDIT IS ANNOUNCED. It writes the row and
    then calls `notify_changed()` — the choke point `DeletionLog.record()` is
    for deletes — so a door cannot tell the owners about an edit without also
    keeping it, or keep one without telling them.
    `NoDoorGoesRoundTheHistoryTests.test_no_door_announces_an_edit_without_keeping_it`
    scans for a caller that goes round it.

    ONLY THE MONEY FIELDS, and only the ones that changed: a figure, the day it
    lands on, which side of the Profit page it sits on. A corrected spelling or
    note is not history — the rule `notify_changed` already follows, so the
    row and its alert always describe the same act. ⚠ The CASHBOOK and a RENT
    DEPOSIT keep only what only an owner could do (`only_past_limits` below)
    — an edit inside Office's 24 hours is the day's work, not a correction.

    NO FOREIGN KEY to the edited row, deliberately. A record edited and then
    deleted must keep its edit history (the deletion is logged too), and a
    ForeignKey would cascade the history away with the record — or PROTECT it
    and make the record undeletable. `object_id` plus a frozen `entity_label`
    is `DeletionLog`'s own discipline.

    No retention limit, for the reasons the owners agreed on 2026-09-22: a row
    is a few hundred bytes, disputes surface months later, and a history that
    forgets on a timer is a loophole with a waiting period.

    setting, and that is the whole reason it exists in this shape (the owner's
    call, 2026-09-20): a host-side switch lives on the hosting account, so
    moving the system — a new host, a backup restored somewhere fresh — leaves
    the section silently OPEN. A row travels with the data: every `pg_dump`,
    every restore, every migration carries it, and if it ever did come back
    open an owner simply presses Lock again.

    Set by an owner from the Legacy Data page, behind three confirmations.
    There is deliberately NO WAY BACK INSIDE THE APP — no button, no page, no
    role — because "somebody can always undo it" is exactly the correction
    threat the lock exists to remove. A genuine mistake is corrected from the
    server with `manage.py unlock_legacy_data --yes`, which is a deliberate act
    by whoever holds the deployment, not a tap.

    `purge_business_data` clears it, because that runs BEFORE go-live and a
    purged system must be ready to type its starting position again.

    Raise HIGH_DISCOUNT when a settled walk-in's discount is past the line.

    A part-paid bill books its shortfall as a discount (see CLAUDE.md — that is
    the business rule, not a bug), which makes an unusually large discount the
    signal worth surfacing rather than the payment itself. Same threshold as
    `audit_high_discounts`, read from one constant so the audit page and the
    alert can never disagree about what "large" means.

    ONE implementation, two callers: settling a bill here, and an unlocked
    edit of a settled card (`jobcard_edit`), which recomputes the discount off
    the new total. The second used to claim, in its own docstring and in the
    Unlock dialog, that a large jump "alerts both owners" — and raised nothing.

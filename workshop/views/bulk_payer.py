    card, so `master_data.py` has to carry the new spelling across the history.
    A Fleet Account is a real row that everything points AT: `JobCard.bulk_payer`
    and `BulkPaymentHistory.bulk_payer` are ForeignKeys, and the Deep Analysis
    fleet section groups by the FK id and pulls the name through the join. So
    one UPDATE reaches the account page, the picker, the fleet insight table and
    the "Fleet · <name>" chip on a printed invoice, with nothing to propagate
    and nothing that can fall out of step.

    Two things deliberately keep the OLD name and must not be "fixed": a
    `DeletionLog` snapshot and a `Notification` body. Both are frozen records of
    what was true when they were written.

    Mirrors `spare_shop_edit`, which is the same shape on the sibling model:
    `__iexact` because the column's `unique=True` is case-sensitive, and
    `.exclude(pk=pk)` because without it a model-level uniqueness check fires

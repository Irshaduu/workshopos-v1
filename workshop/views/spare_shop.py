    Validate and create one unassigned spare on a shop's ledger.

    Returns `(item, error_message)` — exactly one of the two is set.

    Single entry point on purpose. This row is money owed to a supplier, and it
    used to be created by a view that accepted a NEGATIVE price (making the shop
    appear to owe the workshop), a negative or zero quantity, and an oversized
    price that corrupted the ledger. Any second screen that offered "add" would
    have inherited all of it, so the rules live here rather than in a view.

    `raw_price=PRICE_NOT_SUPPLIED` stores NULL rather than zero, and the
    difference is the documented one: zero means the part was free, NULL means
    nobody has priced it yet. That is the Floor case — a mechanic records the
    part that arrived, and Office fills the figure in when the shop's bill is
    keyed. `SpareShop.update_totals()` coalesces NULL to 0, so an unpriced row
    adds nothing to what the shop is owed until it is priced.

    `vehicle_info` is the "Ordered For" note — free text, with no picker and no
    FK, because at the moment somebody records a purchase the car very often has
    no job card to point at yet. It moves no money and joins no table. It is
    TRIMMED to the column rather than allowed to fail, the same rule the name
    follows and for the same reason: an oversized value is stored by SQLite and
    rejected by PostgreSQL, so the only consistent answer is to trim.

    `raw_transport` is what it cost to bring the part in, paid to anyone but the
    shop — never part of the shop's balance (see
    `JobCardSpareItem.transport_cost`). It defaults to "not supplied" so a
    caller that has no such box (the shop page's own add form, Floor) stores
    none. It travels with the part onto a car via "Import from Unassigned".

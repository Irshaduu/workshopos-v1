"""
A car's whole life at this workshop, as one document.

The third customer document, and the first that describes a CAR rather than a
visit. It exists because customers ask for their full record — most often when
selling the car — and today that means opening every job card, printing each
bill and working out the intervals by hand.

What these tests protect is the arithmetic BETWEEN the rows, because that is
the part a customer cannot check against anything. An invoice proves what one
visit cost; nothing proves that '(2) Wheel Bearing — 12,800 km' is right except
this module. So the weight is on the joins: the chain that follows one part
across four years, the gap between two visits, the reading a customer gives
over the phone, and every case where one end of a subtraction is missing.

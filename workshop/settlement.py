What is still unfilled on a job card — one module, no views, TWO readers.

Settling is the last thing that happens to a job card and the only irreversible
one: a walk-in has exactly one payment event, so the moment Office types a
figure the card is marked PAID and whatever was not handed over becomes a
permanent discount (see CLAUDE.md). Every field that was going to be filled in
has to be filled in *before* that, because afterwards the Financial Lock stands
between the card and anyone correcting it.

Two screens ask this module the same question and must get the same answer:

  * the settle dialog on the invoice, BEFORE the money moves — "you are about
    to close this card, here is what nobody filled in";
  * the "Billed but not filled" container on the Live Report, AFTER it — "these
    cards were billed with holes in them, go and fix them".

They are the two halves of one rule, so there is one implementation of it. A
second copy would drift, and it would drift exactly where it matters: a card
the dialog waved through appearing on the chase list, or the reverse.

Nothing here blocks. It is a list of things a person would want to know they
are about to skip. The owner may well settle anyway — a customer standing at
the counter does not wait for a mechanic to tick a box — and the decision stays
theirs.

**The two part routes are checked differently, and that is the `source` rule
again.** A shop spare carries an ordering workflow — a shop, a price, two dates
— and each of those is a real thing that can be forgotten. A warehouse draw
carries none of them: it came off the shelf already fitted, its cost is derived
from the supplier bills, and its `status` column is meaningless. Chasing a draw
for a received date would report a problem that cannot exist and cannot be
fixed, which is how a checklist teaches people to click past it. The one check
spanning both routes is the customer price, because that is the figure that
bills whichever shelf the part came off. It is one check under two NAMES — "no
customer price" on a spare, "no total price" on a draw — because each section's
column is headed that way.

# The chip wordings, named once. Both surfaces render these strings verbatim, so
# they are the vocabulary of the feature rather than incidental copy — a chip
# that reads "Shop Price" on one screen and "No shop price" on the other is two
# screens describing one gap in two voices.
#
# They are LABELS, not sentences: this is read in the two seconds between
# agreeing a price and taking the money, so it is built to be scanned. An
# earlier version explained each gap in a sentence and ran four paragraphs deep,
# which on that screen is the same as saying nothing.

#: The same missing figure on an INVENTORY row, named the way that section's
#: column is. The job card calls it "Total Price" there (2026-09-16, the owners'
#: decision): three money columns sit side by side — Cost / Unit, Unit Price and
#: this one — and "Customer Price" beside "Unit Price" did not say which was the
#: other times the quantity. Spare Parts keeps "Customer Price", because there it
#: sits beside Shop Price and both are line totals. Two words for two screens,
#: each matching the heading above the box somebody is sent to fill.
TOTAL_PRICE = 'Total Price'

#: The same gap said as a PHRASE, and the phrase is what both screens now print.
#:
#: Until 2026-08-17 a gap was drawn as the name of the thing on one line and
#: small red chips on the line under it — so one part missing one figure was two
#: lines and three elements, and a car with a concern and two parts was a
#: fourteen-line block. The owner read that back as "lot of rows and texts to
#: confuse user", and the instruction was to put the thing and what is wrong
#: with it in ONE box: "Castrol Edge 5W-30 — no customer price".
#:
#: DERIVED from the labels above rather than written out beside them. The labels
#: are still the identity of a gap — `count` counts them, and the tests name
#: them — so a second hand-written list would be the same vocabulary twice,
#: free to drift into a screen that chases "Shop Price" in one place and "no
#: supplier price" in another.

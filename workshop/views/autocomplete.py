    Stock products for the Job Card's Inventory section.

    Returns the `id` as well as the name, because the picker writes it into a
    hidden field: the draw is linked by FK, so a product can be renamed without
    detaching it from the job cards that used it. Stock and cost ride along so the
    mechanic can see what is on the shelf while choosing.

    Stock may legitimately be zero or negative — an overdraw awaiting its supplier
    bill — and such products are still offered. Hiding them would block recording
    a part that has physically already been taken, which is the whole reason
    negative stock is allowed.

    **The CATEGORY is searchable, the category is never selectable.** Typing
    "Engine Oil" returns the products inside it — Liqui Moly, Castrol — not a
    row saying "Engine Oil". Those are the two halves of one rule and both are
    needed:

      * A person thinks in the generic term, because that is the word the
        customer uses and the word the printed bill uses (a warehouse draw is
        billed under its category — see `part_display_name`). Matching product
        names only meant searching "Engine Oil" returned nothing at all, and the
        obvious next move is to create a *product* called "Engine Oil", which
        puts the generic name on the shelf as a fake SKU and makes the bill read
        the same either way.
      * What the job card must record is the branded SKU, because that is what
        moves stock and carries the cost. So the category can lead you to the
        product; it can never be the answer.

    `distinct()` because a product could match on both its own name and its
    category's ("Engine Oil 5W-30" inside "Engine Oil"), and an OR across a join
    would then offer it twice.

    What this part usually sells for — a SUGGESTION for the Estimate screen.

    Returns the average customer price per unit over the last few times this
    part name was billed, so the Estimate form can put it in the Unit Price
    box's *placeholder*. It is never written into the field, and nothing on the
    server ever reads it back: a price a human did not type must not be able to
    reach a document a customer is handed. If the hint is wrong, the worst case
    is grey text nobody uses.

    Three decisions worth not re-deriving:

    * **The figure is the CUSTOMER price, not the cost.** It fills a
      customer-facing box, and it is derived with `derive_unit_price`'s own rule
      — `total_price / effective_quantity` — so the suggestion means exactly
      what the printed UNIT PRICE column means. `JobCardSpareItem.unit_price`
      is the workshop's cost and is deliberately NOT read here; suggesting it
      would quote parts at cost.

    * **Job cards only, never past estimates.** A job card is what the workshop
      actually charged and collected. An estimate is a proposal that may have
      been refused, and letting estimates feed each other would let one
      optimistic quote drift the suggestion upward forever with nothing real
      underneath it.

    * **Ordered by most recently recorded** (`-pk`), which is what "the last 5
      entries" means, and it needs no join. Rows with no price are skipped
      before the slice rather than after, so a part priced once and left blank
      four times still returns that one real figure instead of nothing.

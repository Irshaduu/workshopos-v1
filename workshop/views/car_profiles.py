    #    It ordered on `Max(admitted_date)` alone, so a car admitted in June,
    #    finished in July and settled in August sat below one admitted in July
    #    and still untouched since. Everything that happens to a car after it

    #    ⚠ EVERY ARGUMENT TO `Greatest` IS COALESCED, and that is a
    #    cross-database correctness matter rather than tidiness. On PostgreSQL
    #    `GREATEST` ignores NULLs and returns the largest non-null; on SQLite —
    #    which is what the test suite runs on — it returns NULL if ANY argument
    #    is null. A car with no completed_date would therefore sort correctly in
    #    production and vanish to the bottom under test, or the reverse.
    #    `admitted_date` is non-null on every card, so it is the floor.
    #
    #    ⚠ `TruncDate`, never `Cast(... DateField)`, for `paid_date`. It is the
    #    one DateTimeField of the three and it is stored UTC; casting takes the
    #    UTC calendar day, which for anything settled after 18:30 IST is
    #    yesterday. TruncDate converts to TIME_ZONE first, the same thing a
    #    `__date` lookup does.
    #
    #    `-latest_id` breaks ties. Most cars share a date with several others,
    #    and without it the order inside a day is whatever the database happens

# the two questions only a person can answer — what should be on this copy, and

#
# The second question is the one worth having a page for. A customer rings up
# asking for their history; the office asks "what is it reading now?" and types
# it in, and every part currently on the car can then say how far it has run.
# Without it those figures stop at the last visit, which is the one reading the
# customer already knows.

# workshop did not measure it, and writing it to `JobCard.mileage` would put an
# unverified figure into the column every other screen reads and every future
# interval is computed from. It rides in the query string and leaves with the
